Outline of topics


# An Attempt at a Definition

1. Avoiding the No True Scottsman Fallacy

2. Separating engineers from the technicians and analysts

3. What are the tools of engineers? 

4. How is engineering different from science and mathematics?
    The problem is sometimes easier to define as engineering typically just 
    need operable definitions.

    Similar to our the scientists don't deal in investigation of truth, they 
    iterate upon probably mostly correct statements, but they actually deal in 
    fictions closer to the artist or mathematician. I do not mean fictions in
    the sense that what those fictions produce are false, rather that fictions 
    themselves produce scaffolding at understanding deeper levels of potentially
    correct statements. Scientists do not deal in truth because truth is absolute.
    Engineers do not deal in matters of correctness, only in operability because 
    the they only need that level of approximately correct to build a bridge.

    However, how are engineers and scientists different from mathematicians? 
    Simply put, mathematicians are in the business of fictitious truths. Things
    that are absolutely true within themselves but not be proven outside of that realm.
    

    How are mathematicians different from philosophers? 

      - Godel, Bertrand Russell, Wittgenstein

      - Paul Graham on philosophy


# The Nature of Abstraction

# Blind Spots of Some Engineers
  1. The engineers disease

  2. Hyper literal thinking

  3. Specialization and field lenses (thinking only from your training perspective)

  4. Trivialization of other fields problems and complexities
  
  5.
