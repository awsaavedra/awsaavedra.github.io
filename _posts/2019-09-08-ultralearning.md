# Background

We live in a time when you can go on the internet and read about most things
to some level. However, can you learning the equivalent to getting an
undergraduate degree from a top university? Scott Young set out on a bold project
of simulating obtaining the knowledge of a Computer Science degree from MIT
in a year. He called this project the MIT Challenge. Did he succeed in this
challenge? Up to you to decide but he did all the projects, homework, and
passed all the final exams of the classes.

Can others succeed on major projects like this with short time horizons and
aggressive milestones? It turns out a rather sizable learning community exists
from people who can pick up proficiency Common European Framework of Reference for
Languages (CEFR) at B2 level in a month to learning everything required to build
a video game from scratch called _Stardew Valley_ by Eric Barone.

I know what you may be thinking, these people are geniuses and I could never do that
or "I don't have the determination or willpower." I disagree. With practice
many things that seem unreachable are possible and just spending that extra time
can change you a lot in powerful and positive ways. The defining characteristic for
these projects is actually persistence and methods. If you take a step back from
being dazzled by genius, we can see more clearly:

  Better beware of notions like genius and inspiration; they are a sort of magic
  wand and should be used sparingly by anybody who wants to see things clearly.

~José Ortega y Gasset, “Notes on the novel”

Are certain things out of reach? The quote that encapsulates this best is

  I don't believe in setting limits...I find them...

# Why does Ultralearning Matter?

First, an operable definition:

    A strategy for acquiring skills and knowledge that is both self-directed and intense.
    Deeply and effectively learning things is always the main priority.

We live in a society in which learning new skills incredibly quickly is rapidly
becoming not just important, but without the ability to do so one can become _economically
irrelevant_ incredibly fast. I wrote about this in more depth on my post _Deep Work_
if you would like more details. Given how power laws work, i.e. the 80/20 principle,
the top one percent in many areas will be getting the majority of the wealth,
fame, skills, and everything that goes along with a field. How the world is changing
puts one in a position in which it is no longer acceptable to say "I am just no
good at X or Y." When X or Y could very well quickly become part of your job.

Learning new things doesn't necessarily diminish the other skills you have, in fact,
I have found it helps inform other fields through cross pollination of ideas.

Our deepest moment of happiness don't come from simple and easy things,
it comes from wrestling with hard, meaningful things to obtain mastery and self
discovery. Hard decisions, easy life. Easy decisions, hard life.

Education is also getting too expensive, and sometimes too slow, for what you can get online.
One of my best lectures on programming in College pales in comparison to the material I
got online for Java or even the right books on programming. A lot of the course
material in school may not even be indirectly or directly applicable to you as a
learner.

Can technology help solve learning? With websites like Khan Academy, Udacity, Udemy,
Coursera, TedX, etc. We are rapidly seeing the physical lecture room is becoming
less and less relevant. However, a coding Dojo or study Dojos are popping up and
this may become a useful style for us.

So have I convinced you yet? Good. So the three main strategy Scott Young mentions
for acquiring these skills?

  1. Accelerating the career you have.

  2. Transitioning to a new career.

  3. Cultivating a hidden advantage in a competitive world.

However, many ultralearners are not compelled by professional success. The major
reasons were a vision of what they wanted to do, a deep curiosity, or the challenge
that drove these individuals forward. I can say this is highly congruent with
the research I have seen on motivation out of MIT on motivation being tied to
mastery and skill acquisition instead of money. (see link) [RSA animations on motivation].
As Scott Young puts it

    The best ultralearners are those who blend the practical reasons for learning
    a skill with an inspiration that comes from something that excites them.

## What about Talent?

It exists and of course it matters sometimes, but it's clearer now more than ever
that methods and drive mean a lot more than previously thought in many places.
Most people don't say "wow, that persons memory is so good because of talent" at the memory
expert contests--we all know it is training. No one seems to fully know the
composition of training and talent but we know we can grow so let's just work on
that. Jumping into ultralearning means you too can radically shift your skill in an
area and it's quite empowering. Results may vary.

## How to Become an Ultralearner

    What differentiated de Montebello wasn’t that he thought he could go from
    near-zero experience to the finalist for the World Championship in six months.
    Rather, it was his obsessive work ethic. His goal wasn’t to reach some
    predetermined extreme but to see how far he could go.

Once again, this is the determining factor.

Principles of the Ultralearner:

  1. **Metalearning**: First Draw a Map. Start by learning how to learn the subject
    or skill you want to tackle. Discover how to do good research and how to draw on
    your past competencies to learn new skills more easily.  

    2. **Focus** Sharpen Your Knife. Cultivate the ability to concentrate.
    Carve out chunks of time when you can focus on learning, and make it easy to just do it.  

    3. **Directness**: Go Straight Ahead. Learn by doing the thing you want to become good at.
    Don’t trade it off for other tasks, just because those are more convenient or comfortable.  

    4. **Drill**: Attack Your Weakest Point. Be ruthless in improving your weakest points.
    Break down complex skills into small parts; then master those parts and build them back together again.  

    5. **Retrieval**: Test to Learn. Testing isn’t simply a way of assessing knowledge but a way of creating it.
    Test yourself before you feel confident, and push yourself to actively recall information
    rather than passively review it.  

    6. **Feedback**: Don’t Dodge the Punches. Feedback is harsh and uncomfortable.
    Know how to use it without letting your ego get in the way.
    Extract the signal from the noise, so you know what to pay attention to and what to ignore.  

    7. **Retention**: Don’t Fill a Leaky Bucket. Understand what you forget and why.
    Learn to remember things not just for now but forever.  

    8. **Intuition**: Dig Deep Before Building Up.
    Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills.
    Understand how understanding works, and don’t recourse to cheap. tricks of memorization to avoid deeply knowing things.

    9. **Experimentation**: Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone. All of these principles are only starting points. True mastery comes not just from following the path trodden by others but from exploring possibilities they haven’t yet imagined.

Scott Young got these principles from meta-analysis, personal experience, and the available cognitive science literature. Many of us have used these ideas in our studies
and lives but to systemize this into an extremely effective process takes a lot more than understanding these concepts in principle. The practice is hard. Put another way **common sense isn't common practice**. And remember kids, sometimes you need to know when to break the rules. These are all heuristics mind you, not scientific laws.


## Metalearning

**Cross pollination between skills**:

    "Who has not learned something more about themselves
    by watching the activities of others?
    To learn the sword study the guitar.
    To learn the fist study commerce.
    To just study the sword will make you
    narrow-minded and will not permit you to grow outward."

Miyamoto Musashi, _A Book of Five Rings_. This kind of skill interaction can sometimes even be between seemingly unrelated skills.
The story Scott Young covers is how multilingual people vs. monolingual do on acquiring a new language. The multilingual people learn faster.
 What happens is a form of meta awareness, in this case between different languages. This meta-framework can be derived more easily from studying in a formal setting.

I am a philosophical _patternist_ so this philosophy of acquiring numerous skills to weave even more
sophisticated patterns between things in the world cannot be emphasized enough.
Patterns have _emergent_ properties to them, put simply:
patterns have a power that transcends the parts of that pattern.
The whole is greater than the sum of it's parts. As was true above, so is it is true below. This is one of the reasons acquiring metaskills is such a powerful skill. [**TODO**:] link to a large metaskills markdown doc.

So how do you draw your metalearning map?

    Over the short term, you can do research to focus on improving your
     metalearning before and during a learning project. Ultralearning,
    owing to its intensity and self-directed nature,
    has the opportunity for a lot higher variance than normal
    schooling efforts do. A good ultralearning project, with excellent materials and an awareness of what needs to be learned, has the potential to be completed faster than formal schooling.

How is this possible according to Scott Young?

    This is because you can tailor your project to your exact needs and
    abilities, avoiding the one-size-fits-all approach taken in school.
    [...] Metalearning research avoids this problem and helps you seek
    out points where you might even be able to get a significant
    advantage over the status quo.

Scott Young breaks up metalearning stages into "Why?", "What?", and "How?".

  1. **Why** am I learning this? Motivation.

      - Is the project intrinsic (for it's own sake) or instrumental (with a particular goal).

      - If the project is for more _instrumental_ reasons, do an additional step of research to answer whether the skill will actually help you toward your goal.

      - Conduct expert interviews, if they think your methodology and map are not effective further evaluate. You don't want
       misalignment between goal and project. Don't ask for long chunks of time, 30 minutes will do.

Young, Scott. Ultralearning (p. 59). HarperBusiness. Kindle Edition.

  2. **What** knowledges and abilities do I need to acquire to learn
   this? Break things down into things like concepts, facts, and procedures.

  3. **How** will I learn this? Resources, environment, and methods
  you will need to learn. Evaluate each carefully.

      - Emphasize/Exclude Method happens after you have found the default
      curriculum to use
      i.e. if you goal is app development build apps and don't study upper level computational math. Also, remove or delay elemnts of your curriculum that don't align with your goals.

How much time should you up into your research? Probably 10 percent, but this is highly contextual and the law of diminishing
returns applies on the other end of doing too much research.

The long term benefit of these projects is clear though: they develop the ability to learn hard things which is typically more valuable than
any one skillset.

## Focus

Everyone knows it matters. However, becoming unfocused is much more common and a bigger problem. What are the types of ways to lose focus? Starting/procrastinating, sustaining, and optimizing the quality of focus.


  1. **Procrastinating** is a systemic issue for many people and we all know it. Some people procrastinate everything, others only in particular areas. Figure out which areas are your worst and use techniques like: timeboxing, the pomodoro technique, and shutting off distracting technologies like cellphones, computers, etc. I wrote a blog post on both removing distractions (digital minimalism) and sustaining focus (deep work). You need to recognize your procrastination triggers and work hard to resist them. Sometimes you can just say "we only need to do this for 5 minutes." If you are taking too many breaks timeboxing or the pomodoro technique are your best bet. If one stage is too hard, don't feel bad about rolling things back and working from a previous stage.

  2. **Sustaining** focus on a specific task is the goal. Flow is typically touted as the ability to sustain focus for long stretches of time and is considered desirable. However, flow can be a major issue since hard and meaningful tasks can cause flow to be removed since the struggle is not comfortable. Scott Young also doesn't seem to be really into this trendy idea of low. Be skeptical of things that seem easy or enjoyable when it comes to accomplishing hard things. Toilets need proper flow, people do not.

      - Interleaving: the process of studying in spaced out chunks. Not too long you forget, but not too short to be cramming. So study different topics in a chunk of time, not just one small area.

      - Rule of thumb for deeply focused studying: 45 minutes to 1 hour. You probably have 4-5 solid chunks you can take advantage of intense study. Then you need to switch to shallow work like email and light reading.

      - Distraction sources: environment, your task, your minded

          - Environment: no multitasking, flashing lights, random noises, lighting that will make you drowsy, etc. The most hardcore is Linus Torvalds workspace.

          - Task: Take notes, reexplain concepts to yourself, recall ideas, walk around. Many tips exist and I put many in the deep work section I wrote about.

          - Mind: Meditation, taking 30 minutes before a task to do something like shower, cook, etc. that dump distractions from your brain.
