# Background

We live in a time when you can go on the internet and read about most things
to some level. However, can you learning the equivalent to getting an
undergraduate degree from a top university? Scott Young set out on a bold project
of simulating obtaining the knowledge of a Computer Science degree from MIT
in a year. He called this project the MIT Challenge. Did he succeed in this
challenge? Up to you to decide but he did all the projects, homework, and
passed all the final exams of the classes.

Can others succeed on major projects like this with short time horizons and
aggressive milestones? It turns out a rather sizable learning community exists
from people who can pick up proficiency Common European Framework of Reference for
Languages (CEFR) at B2 level in a month to learning everything required to build
a video game from scratch called _Stardew Valley_ by Eric Barone.

I know what you may be thinking, these people are geniuses and I could never do that
or "I don't have the determination or willpower." I disagree. With practice
many things that seem unreachable are possible and just spending that extra time
can change you a lot in powerful and positive ways. The defining characteristic for
these projects is actually persistence and methods. If you take a step back from
being dazzled by genius, we can see more clearly:

  Better beware of notions like genius and inspiration; they are a sort of magic
  wand and should be used sparingly by anybody who wants to see things clearly.

~José Ortega y Gasset, “Notes on the novel”

Are certain things out of reach? The quote that encapsulates this best is

  I don't believe in setting limits...I find them...
