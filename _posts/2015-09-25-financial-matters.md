## Background

After much frustration with overly complex explanations of financial matters I
decided back to write a simplified version of financial material for the
average person as a template for life that met the following criteria:

  1. **Comprehensible**: Easy to understand.

  2. **Implementable**: Simple to follow.

  3. **Maximize Psychological Safety**: Least stress and experiencing of negative emotions while having this portfolio. Ideally, the user will never care of pay attention to almost any market events.

  4. **Automatable**: Set it and forget it.

  5. **Robustness**: in this case meaning most worst case scenarios are covered

    a. Able to handle financial downturns without
    withdrawing from assets of high volatility

    b. Portfolios with different purposes: one(s) for
    conservative growth and one
    for higher growth with optimal risk adjusted return
    (Sharpe ratio is good).

  6. **Extensible**: easily extended by users or additional complexity can be added
  without issue.

  7. **Optimally shielded**: assets protected from  inflation and other portfolio diminishing scenarios.

### Disclaimer and Basics on Retirement

  I am simply an enthusiastic lay person
  who happens to know some math, a fair bit of personal finance,
  and likes reading on the topic. Please consult a professional who is qualified for specific advice related to your financial situation.
  This means I don't want to answer YOUR specific questions and I don't want to get
  into the weeds.

**I prefer to teach people how to think about fishing, NOT even how to fish.**

## Tax Advantaged Accounts

What are tax advantaged accounts? Retirement accounts, health savings accounts, and
numerous others. They typically come in two forms: pre-tax meaning money you can
set aside before being taxed on the money and post-tax meaning money you have already
been taxed on. The current notable exception is the health savings account (HSA)  
which is an account that is actually NEVER taxed

REMEMBER [Frontloading](http://www.madfientist.com/front-loading/) or, if youâ€™re able to handle spiciness, mega frontloading with [credit card arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-arbitrage.asp)

Order of maxing out of tax-sheltered accounts
1) 401k
2) HSA
3) Traditional IRA, or Roth if income is too high
4) After-Tax Contributions to 401k if possible, [direct rollover to Roth afterward](https://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/)

**NOTES**:
  1. ALL MAX LIMITS AND INCOME LIMITS ARE MOVING TARGETS
  2. RULES AND ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE YEARLY

Total contribution limit per year example: [( pre-tax 401k + post-tax 401k contributions) /SEP IRA] + [Roth + IRA = IRS limit] + HSA

Important considerations about the below tax advantaged accounts:

a. Am I able to contribute to X tax advantaged account? Is my income too high/low,
any special rules due to my citizenship, industry, etc.

b. What are the contribution limits for the year?

c. If I can use X and Y tax advantaged account, which one is better for my situation and why?

d. Do I need to focus on other matters like paying off debt, saving for a down payment
on a house, paying medical bills, etc. instead of maxing these accounts out?
