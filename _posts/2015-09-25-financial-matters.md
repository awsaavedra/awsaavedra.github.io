# Disclaimer

  I am simply an enthusiastic lay person
  who happens to know some math, a fair bit of personal finance,
  and likes reading on the topic. Please consult a professional who is qualified for specific advice related to your financial situation.
  This means I don't want to answer YOUR specific questions and I don't want to get
  into the weeds.

**I prefer to teach people how to think about fishing, NOT even how to fish.**

## Background

After much frustration with overly complex explanations of financial matters I
decided to write a simplified version of financial material for the
average person as a template for financial solution that met the following criteria:

  1. **Comprehensible**: Easy to understand.

  2. **Implementable**: Simple to make.

  3. **Maximize Psychological Safety**: Least stress and experiencing of negative emotions while having this portfolio. Ideally, the user will never care of pay attention to almost any market events.

  4. **Automatable**: Set it and forget it.

  5. **Robustness**: in this case meaning most worst case scenarios are covered

    a. Able to handle financial downturns without
    withdrawing from assets of high volatility

    b. Portfolios with different purposes: one(s) for
    conservative growth and one
    for higher growth with optimal risk adjusted return
    (Sharpe ratio is good).

  6. **Extensible**: easily extended by users or additional complexity can be added
  without issue.

  7. **Optimally shielded**: assets protected from  inflation and other portfolio diminishing scenarios.

## Tax Advantaged Accounts

What are tax advantaged accounts? Retirement accounts, health savings accounts, and
numerous others. They typically come in two forms: pre-tax meaning money you can
set aside before being taxed on the money and post-tax meaning money you have already
been taxed on. The current notable exception is the health savings account (HSA)  
which is an account that is actually NEVER taxed.

Typical order of maxing out of tax-sheltered accounts:
1. 401k
2. HSA
3. Traditional IRA, or Roth if income is too high
4. After-Tax Contributions to 401k if possible, [direct rollover to Roth afterward](https://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/)

REMEMBER [Front-loading](http://www.madfientist.com/front-loading/) or, if youâ€™re able to handle spiciness, mega front-loading with [credit card arbitrage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-card-arbitrage.asp)


**NOTES**:
  1. ALL MAX LIMITS AND INCOME LIMITS ARE MOVING TARGETS
  2. RULES AND ACCOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE YEARLY

Total contribution limit per year **example**: [( pre-tax 401k + post-tax 401k contributions) /SEP IRA] + [Roth + IRA = IRS limit] + HSA

Important considerations about the tax advantaged accounts:

1. Am I able to contribute to X tax advantaged account? Is my income too high/low,
any special rules due to my citizenship, industry, etc.

2. What are the contribution limits for the year?

3. If I can use X and Y tax advantaged account, which one is better for my situation and why?

4. Do I need to focus on other matters like paying off debt, saving for a down payment
on a house, paying medical bills, etc. instead of maxing these accounts out?

### Safety Margins

Safety margins are simply levels of safety built into a financial architecture: simply put, if a higher level fails then the next layer can back you up. For instance, if one loses their 1. primary income their 2. side hustle(s) could sustain them until they find another primary.

(total assets) / (spending per year) = X years worth of assets

1. Primary Income Source(s)
2. Side Hustle(s)
3. Checking Account: one to two months of expenses
4. Safety Net: 6 to 12 months of expenses
5. Tax Sheltered Accounts
6. Post tax portfolio(s), business ventures, gambling, etc.

### Hierarchy of Financial Stability

0. **Survival**: Living paycheck to paycheck and potentially debt
1. **Stability**: Able to cover all expenses.
2. **Accumulation**: Saving excess money income.
3. **Independence**: Able to pay all expenses with investment income.
4. **Abundance**: One can spend/give in fulfillment of life's purpose.

### Suggested Services

1. A solid checking account that allows international withdraws w/o penalty and ideally
high interest

2. A command center for all financial flow like spending

3. A cheap mutual fund provider that's dirt cheap using index funds

4. Credit lines you can use everyday and receive continuous discounts

5. Automate, automate, Automate

6. Streamline and simplify as much as possible
