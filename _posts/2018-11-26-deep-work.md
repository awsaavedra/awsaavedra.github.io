Before I begin the summary let me mention somethings about this philosophy of deep work purely from my perspective: 

The reality is that we are in an era in which shallow and low priority tasks consume our time from social media sites, to low quality tv shows that don't tell us stories of what it means to be human or how to care for one another. 

The best way to drown out highly valuable information rich content is not through suppression but with dilution; just dump so much information into the world that filtering out irrelevancy becomes increasingly difficult. 
In an information satured world with low quality content is the norm, deep thought and grappling with big ideas is the exception, the craftsman, deep worker, and thoughtful people are the exception. Our time needs to be well spent, whatever that means to you, and in many cases being constantly connected provides the opposite.

This book is primary answering the question of how one gains valuable skills in the 
job market and getting increasingly high amounts of work done. Cal Newport's answer is deep
work.

### What is Deep Work and how is it valauble?

The definition provided in the book is 
  
  Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration 
  that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.
  These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

The book starts to cover some of the big names who use deep work which include:
Carl Jung, Bill Gates, Neal Stephenson. Deep work is ubiquitious amongst influential
people and it makes sense why given their high production of work.

Why are knowledge workers losing their connection with deep work? Network tools, 
such as social media, reddit, buzzfeed, etc. These network tools do not allows us 
to dive deep when we stay in the shallows so often. It is training our brain
for the opposite of deep work.

Shallo work can be defined as:

  Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, performed with frazzled or distracted.
  The key is that this work is not proviing much new value in the world.

The scary part is that this frenetic shallowness can _permanently_ lower your 
ability to do deep work. I hope that thought scares you as much as it does for me.

His main points about why you should consider deep work valuable is:

  1. As time goes along, less people will be doing deep work which adds more value
    to the economy than shallow work creating a competitive advantage.

  2. The network effect of digital technologies make the impact of your work even
    more noticable given the shallow material generally presented--so your work
    is potentialy rewarded even more.

The goals of the book are to convince you that the above assertions are true 
and to take the bull by the horns using deep work in your own life. A potential 
side effect is that your personal life improves because you are getting tons done
very effectively, highly quality + quickly, so you have more free time in your 
personal life. Make boredom your friend, you can relax more easily that way. More 
on this later. 

To quote Cal Newport: _A deep life is a good life._

### How is Deep Work Valuable?

The robots are coming for shallow work first. Many of the daily tasks we do like
data entry, reading and replying to email, driving an automobile, basic customer 
service, etc. are going to be first. Who will thrive when most knowledge workers
and people in general are unable to do the harder and deep tasks? Deep workers.

In the book _Average is Over_ which covers the three groups who will profit from
this:
  
  1. The High-Skilled Workers. Those who can work well with complex technologies 
    such as data visualization, rapid prototyping, analytics, and others. Can 
    you play well with intelligent machines e.g. Nate Silver?

  2. The Superstars in a field. In zero sum markets you can actually model talent
      using Sherwin Rosen's work: "Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does 
      not add up to a single outstanding performance." Like many things in life, 
      it functions under power laws, or if you like, earthquake scales which get
      increasingly powerful with each incremental increase. The better you are,
      the more you get for it. If an employer can hire the best, they will hire
      the best. Elitism in free market economics is probably inevitable. 

  3. The Owners of capital to invest in the Great Restructuring. Think Venture 
      Capitalists, billionaires, etc. Those who own intelligent machines will control
      things. Think of them as the new Master's of Men from the _Wealth of Nations_
      book. Think of companies like Snapchat or Instagram, way less people work
      there than most think. Under 20 sometimes.

Can you do well without being in these groups? Probably, but it is less clear.

For most of us the third category is not easily attained, but one and two are.

So what are the general set of skills needed?

  1. Meta-learning and then quickly mastering difficult things.

  2. Highly effective, quality and speed, production.

If you cannot do one and two above, you will not thrive in the new economy. 
One will become rapidly economically irrelevant. One needs deep work to thrive.

Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges said in _The Intellectual life_:

  Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention;
  let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your 
  mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing idea.

He also stated that you must systematically grapple with the relevant topics
to enabling your attention to converge on an uncovered truth latent within each
area. 

What is one thing that we can use to do this? One tool is called *Deliberate 
Practice* which is simply deliberate effort to improve performance in an area.

What are the keys to deliberate practice?

  1. Attention is focused tightly on a specific skill one is enhancing, or master.

  2. One has a tight feedback loop on their current level, without feedback how
    do you know you are improving?

The good news is natural talent does not play a huge role, which means many of us
can become top performers. The bad news is few shortcuts exist. Thus, dedicating 
intense effort and practice on a single point of study, work, etc. is the key to
massive results. Innate talent is overrated and exaggerated in peoples minds.

From a Neuroscience perspective "To be great at something is to be well myelinated"
and you need to continuously use specific neural circuits to do this. Those neurons 
that fire together wire together. 

If you start to see these things as scientific problems it becomes clearer
you need to batch interrelated important tasks into deep work sessions without 
interruption.

  HQ Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

Additionally, being distracted creates *attention residue* which has effects 
well after you have left a shallow task. I call this *task switch cost*, which
reduces the current effectiveness of your work since your mind is distracted 
with a previous task.
