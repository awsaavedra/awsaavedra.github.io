Before I begin the summary let me mention somethings about this philosophy of deep work purely from my perspective: 

The reality is that we are in an era in which shallow and low priority tasks consume our time from social media sites, to low quality tv shows that don't tell us stories of what it means to be human or how to care for one another. 

The best way to drown out highly valuable information rich content is not through suppression but with dilution; just dump so much information into the world that filtering out irrelevancy becomes increasingly difficult. 
In an information satured world with low quality content is the norm, deep thought and grappling with big ideas is the exception, the craftsman, deep worker, and thoughtful people are the exception. Our time needs to be well spent, whatever that means to you, and in many cases being constantly connected provides the opposite.

This book is primary answering the question of how one gains valuable skills in the 
job market and getting increasingly high amounts of work done. Cal Newport's answer is deep
work.

### What is Deep Work and how is it valauble?

The definition provided in the book is 
  
  Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration 
  that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.
  These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

The book starts to cover some of the big names who use deep work which include:
Carl Jung, Bill Gates, Neal Stephenson. Deep work is ubiquitious amongst influential
people and it makes sense why given their high production of work.

Why are knowledge workers losing their connection with deep work? Network tools, 
such as social media, reddit, buzzfeed, etc. These network tools do not allows us 
to dive deep when we stay in the shallows so often. It is training our brain
for the opposite of deep work.

Shallo work can be defined as:

  Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, performed with frazzled or distracted.
  The key is that this work is not proviing much new value in the world.

The scary part is that this frenetic shallowness can _permanently_ lower your 
ability to do deep work. I hope that thought scares you as much as it does for me.

His main points about why you should consider deep work valuable is:

  1. As time goes along, less people will be doing deep work which adds more value
    to the economy than shallow work creating a competitive advantage.

  2. The network effect of digital technologies make the impact of your work even
    more noticable given the shallow material generally presented--so your work
    is potentialy rewarded even more.

The goals of the book are to convince you that the above assertions are true 
and to take the bull by the horns using deep work in your own life. A potential 
side effect is that your personal life improves because you are getting tons done
very effectively, highly quality + quickly, so you have more free time in your 
personal life. Make boredom your friend, you can relax more easily that way. More 
on this later. 

To quote Cal Newport: _A deep life is a good life._

### How is Deep Work Valuable?

The robots are coming for shallow work first. Many of the daily tasks we do like
data entry, reading and replying to email, driving an automobile, basic customer 
service, etc. are going to be first. Who will thrive when most knowledge workers
and people in general are unable to do the harder and deep tasks? Deep workers.

In the book _Average is Over_ which covers the three groups who will profit from
this:
  
  1. The High-Skilled Workers. Those who can work well with complex technologies 
    such as data visualization, rapid prototyping, analytics, and others. Can 
    you play well with intelligent machines e.g. Nate Silver?

  2. The Superstars in a field. In zero sum markets you can actually model talent
      using Sherwin Rosen's work: "Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does 
      not add up to a single outstanding performance." Like many things in life, 
      it functions under power laws, or if you like, earthquake scales which get
      increasingly powerful with each incremental increase. The better you are,
      the more you get for it. If an employer can hire the best, they will hire
      the best. Elitism in free market economics is probably inevitable. 

  3. The Owners of capital to invest in the Great Restructuring. Think Venture 
      Capitalists, billionaires, etc. Those who own intelligent machines will control
      things. Think of them as the new Master's of Men from the _Wealth of Nations_
      book. Think of companies like Snapchat or Instagram, way less people work
      there than most think. Under 20 sometimes.

Can you do well without being in these groups? Probably, but it is less clear.

For most of us the third category is not easily attained, but one and two are.

So what are the general set of skills needed?

  1. Meta-learning and then quickly mastering difficult things.

  2. Highly effective, quality and speed, production.

If you cannot do one and two above, you will not thrive in the new economy. 
One will become rapidly economically irrelevant. One needs deep work to thrive.

Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges said in _The Intellectual life_:

  Let your mind become a lens, thanks to the converging rays of attention;
  let your soul be all intent on whatever it is that is established in your 
  mind as a dominant, wholly absorbing idea.

He also stated that you must systematically grapple with the relevant topics
to enabling your attention to converge on an uncovered truth latent within each
area. 

What is one thing that we can use to do this? One tool is called *Deliberate 
Practice* which is simply deliberate effort to improve performance in an area.

What are the keys to deliberate practice?

  1. Attention is focused tightly on a specific skill one is enhancing, or master.

  2. One has a tight feedback loop on their current level, without feedback how
    do you know you are improving?

The good news is natural talent does not play a huge role, which means many of us
can become top performers. The bad news is few shortcuts exist. Thus, dedicating 
intense effort and practice on a single point of study, work, etc. is the key to
massive results. Innate talent is overrated and exaggerated in peoples minds.

From a Neuroscience perspective "To be great at something is to be well myelinated"
and you need to continuously use specific neural circuits to do this. Those neurons 
that fire together wire together. 

If you start to see these things as scientific problems it becomes clearer
you need to batch interrelated important tasks into deep work sessions without 
interruption.

  HQ Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

Additionally, being distracted creates *attention residue* which has effects 
well after you have left a shallow task. I call this *task switch cost*, which
reduces the current effectiveness of your work since your mind is distracted 
with a previous task. You need to do deep work to optimize your HQ Work Production
capacity. Unless you're in a few caveated positions Newport mentions like the
profoundly talent, CEO, and others who do not require deep work for their job,
one will ultimately need work to succeed. Can you think of many niches where shallow
work is the better option and are those fields shrinking or growing?

One researcher, Gloria Mark at UC Irvine, has studied the effect of *attention
fragmentation* on workers. The summary is that short interruptions increase the 
total time spent by a high amount. [find a link to her work] Unforunately for 
the deep worker, trends is businesses are reducing the possibility for deep work
e.g. open office plans, company chat systems in which people expect immediate 
responses.

Some terms in this section I found useful to name the issue: *culture of connectivity*,
*Principle of Least Resistance* (doing the work that's low hanging fruit first
instead of the harder stuff), *bewildering psychic landscape* by Crawford in 
_Shop Class as Soulcraft_, _Technopoly_, _The Internet_ by Morozov

Richard Feynman, everyone's favorite physicist states:

  To do real good physics work, you do need absolute solid lengths of time...
  it needs a lot of concentration...if you have a job administrating anything,
  you don't have the time. So I have invented another myth for myself: that I'm
  irresponsible. I'm actively irresponsible. I tell everyone I don't do anything.
  If anyone asks me to be on a committee for admissions, "no," I tell them: I'm
  irresponsible.

Speaking personally, anything I can automate, push off, etc. 
will be done in time so that I can filter out irrelevancy in my life. I am rarely 
busy outside of work or minor obligations. This reduces stress and life is too
short for bullshit. Do you agree? Prioritizing, optimizing, and a general discipline
creates more freedom, less stress, and more room for what matters. Who doesn't 
want that, but who is willing to put in the work?

### Is Deep Work Meaningful?

He brings up the idea of the Craftsman Mindset eloquently stated
by Ric Furrer, a blacksmith 
  I do all my work by hand and use tools that multiply 
  my force without limiting my creativity or interactivity with the material
  What may take me 100 blows by hand can be accomplished in one by a large
  swaging machine. This is the antithesis of my goal and to that end all my work 
  shows evidence of the two hands that made it

Another quote by Matthew Crawford  that complements Furrer well:

  The satisfactions of manifesting oneself concretely in the world through
  manual competence have been known to make a man quiet and easy.

So what does this craftsman economy have to do with the information economy?
Let us go to the scientific research

To quote Winifred Gallagher in her 2009 book _Rapt_:

  Like Fingers pointing to the moon, other diverse disciplines from anthropology 
  to education, behavioral economics to family counseling, similarly suggest that 
  the skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life
  and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.

  [...] Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love--is the sum of
  what you focus on.

That's some seriously stoic shit. One of the scientist quoted in the book to try
to make this seem true is Barbara Fredrickson, who specializes in cognitive
appraisal of emotions states that simple choices can provide a "reset button."

For example, if you are annoyed at your S.O. about unequal chores
  
  Rather than continuing to focus on your partner's selfishness and sloth you might
  focus on the fact thta at least a festering conflict has been aired, which is 
  the first step toward a solution to the problem, and your improved mood.

By adding emotional "leverage points" your emotional stated after events can be 
improved. To be honest, this is basically just a bunch of stoic and zen  
philosophy with some studies to back it up. To the astitute reader of this blog
you should already be aware of these philosophies and actively practicing these.
