title: A Set of Predictions for the Future

Some things on my mind recently:

1. How do we channel and unleash self teaching and creativity more reliably?

        https://www.edge.org/response-detail/23879

        The Torchlight List: Around the World in 200 Books
          James Flynn has the right idea, IMHO, get people reading and
          thinking on their own. How do we translate that into polymaths and unleashing creative people? I have no idea.

2) Universal basic income will become a necessity given the robots are comings for your jobs.

          Goes over every sound argument I have heard against "But jobs will
          continue to be around" arguments and destroys them.

3) Humanity is doing better now than ever before:

        Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress

4) To contradict 3, what about all these things...?

        a) Climate change

        b) The singularity

        c) Mass biological warfare

  My strategy is prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Prepare now.
