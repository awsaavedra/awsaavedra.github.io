In the past year I have [reduced my carbon footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint#Measuring_carbon_footprints) to about 10% that of an average American without much effort. How?

Before telling other people how to live on a particular axis I have found
it is a good idea to examine ourselves thoroughly first. I know, I know-- where is the fun in that?

Turns out, lots! You could optimize your environmental impact while also saving a ton
of time and cash. How you may ask? Are you going to try to sell me something? No, this isn't that kind of blog.

What I will mention is the very conveniences that provide our lives with minor benefits
are actually easy to gradually remove without actually noticing. Before I get
into the nuts and bolts of this let me first start off by saying that you shouldn't
sweat the small stuff. I mean it.

I prefer to see what works and then spread the word on major simple ways to reduce my carbon footprint.

Major contributors to individual carbon footprint:

  1. Consumption: food, new toys, etc. Buy second hand, digital copies instead of physical books.

      a. Food: Plants over meat, dried goods since fridges take lots of energy. Eat and make food at home.

      b. Digital over physical: books use paper, you get the idea. Anything you can digitize you should. Lugging more stuff requires more resources

      c. Second hand, free off of websites like freecycle.org (after pandemics yes yes)

      d. Buy classic items that last a long time. [Buy it for life or long periods](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/) of time.

  2. Traveling: how are you getting places? Try bikes, carpooling, walking, public transport.

  3. Power: how are you getting power for your home, business, etc.? You could chase out electric demons quite easily by

      a. Measuring power consumption and reducing it further

      b. Open up windows, lighting areas with skylights, use natural light more often

      c. Further reading is [chasing electric demons](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2015/03/25/cut-your-power-bill/)

      d. Wear warm clothes during the winter and have a passive cooling system within the house. Aka, heat/cool the individual not the house.

  4. Choose high quality leisure activities that are also environmentally friendly. Biking, outdoor activities, tennis...monster truck rallies (joking!)

In short, by just doing a couple things you can reduce your footprint massively. Heck, turn it into a game and find creative solutions to reducing your footprint! It seems daunting at first, but becomes simpler as time goes along. Cheers.
