title: The Originals: Actionable Items from the book
---

I rarely come away from a book with some solid actionable insights but luckily for me
this book had some stellar information and a solid data driven approach to viewing
the power of original thinking and insights.

Before I get into the actionable insights from the book let me point out the most
shocking data table I saw in the entire book:

| Artistic hobby        | Odds for Nobel Prize winners relative to typical scientist   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Music: playing an instrument, composing, conducting     | 2x greater |
| Arts: drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpting      | 7x greater|  
| Crafts: woodworking, mechanics, electronics, glassblowing  |  7.5x greater |
| Writing: poetry, plays, novels, short stories,  essays, popular books  |  12x greater      |
| Performing: amateur actor, dancer, magician  |  22x greater      |
