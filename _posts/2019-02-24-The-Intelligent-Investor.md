_The Intelligent Investor_ and _Security Analysis_ is the only investment books I ever needed to read, all the others were further elaboration on Benjamin Graham's points. I decided to do this book review because the principles to preserve wealth, reducing the amount of false positives, and truly investing for the long run (the only investment that exists) are timeless techniques. For the purposes of brevity I will focus primarily on what Benjamin Graham calls a **Defensive Investor** instead of the **Enterprising Investor**.

### Why Am I Focusing on Defensive Investors and not talking about Enterprising Investors?

Many people try, and typically fail, to beat the market averages for many reasons, but the reality is that most people think they're above average [lake will-ba-gon example] when in fact that's statistically impossible. Can _YOU_ beat the market consistently for decades? You can try, but it is likely that you will fail due to sheer time required, temperamental and intellectual advantage within the market, and the element of markets becoming more efficient particularly at the large capital end i.e. companies in the S&P 500.

To truly beat the market over long time spans one has to have patience, extreme patience, and an ability to focus on the larger goal while keeping their emotions in check for decades. It is a slow, turbulent, and boring process for most. People like Warren Buffett, Joel Greenblatt, Charlie Munger, and Ray Dalio are not just rare, they're exceptional in ways beyond just mental powers beyond what we consider measurable like IQ.

If you read Vanguard's (The Case for Index Funds)[link] you will realize most "experts" are nothing more than highly paid money managers who on the whole detract from your portfolio returns by "managing" them when a simple index fund would beat 80%+ of these managers. But wait you say, what about the other ~20+% of managers, why don't I just go with them? That group is not a consistent batch of people so how are you supposed to pick the best fund managers if they don't even know who they are?

    Consider 1000 people trying to guess a coin toss.
    Lets say half guess heads and the other half guess tails.
    This keeps happening so 500 people are left,
    then 250, 125, etc. until only one person is left.

Is this person an oracle? Do they have some amazing insight beyond mere mortals? No, they are the last person because that's just what happens when you have so many rounds. What if you keep testing this person without others to elimination, I can almost guarantee you after a large amount of coin tosses it will become clear they cannot guess better than the average person. To extend the same logic here,
managers who are "lucky" are no better than average most likely. They are simply "lucky" on the average. However, people who consistently show the ability to predict companies and market moments and they are rare, but to believe you are one potentially true, but highly unlikely without a track record.

Have I talked you out of trying to beat the market yet? If not, consider the stress of pursuing a investment almost full time. You will need to constantly look for valuable companies, second guess yourself constantly, fail, retry, and in the end what if it turns out you just putting that money in an index would have outperformed all your wasted effort by doing literally nothing after investing the money? Wouldn't that be a horrible feeling? From just an emotional and social perspective you would sacrifice so much with such a high likelihood of failure knocking at your door every day. The market enticing you constantly will noise about hot new companies and ideas, you would have to constantly pour over the companies for a single needle in a haystack of companies looking for just a single one that's a good company that's undervalued, well managed, has an economic mote, etc. Does that sound like how you want to spend every working hour or most of your free hours? For most of you, I don't think so.

The defining Principles of Intelligent Investing

  1. Invest for **profits overtime**, not for quick buy and sell transactions.

  2. Have confidence in **your own reasoning** [ so simply don't follow the crowd].

  3. Choose investments for their **fundamental value**, not for their popularity.

  4. **Understand the business** you're investing in.

  5. Know the **key people** running the business.

  6. _Always_ invest with a **margin of safety**.




Ideas can I can elaborate on:

  1) Market inefficiency is the enterprising investors friend, because more companies are being sold for below true value. Who wouldn't want to get dollars for quarters?

  2)
