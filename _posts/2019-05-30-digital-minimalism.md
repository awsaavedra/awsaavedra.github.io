### Background
Something is wrong with us now days. Why cannot we live with a tiny bit of boredom,
stimulation, or compulsively checking social media? After going through Cal Newport's
books: _Deep Work_ and _So Good They Can't Ignore You_ I had to pick up his most
recent work on the subject of software technology in our lives.
This book isn't just about getting work done, it is about getting your life
back from companies who want your attention. The business model is clear: increase
your attention on their products and extract more money. One may ask, is this good for
society or is it a net negative for our culture? In Cal Newport's latest book, it is
clear what his answer is: when used how these platforms intend it, it is a net negative
to our health and productivity as individuals. I won't pretend to stay neutral on this
since the evidence is clearer than ever. We need to get these tools under our
control.


### The Gist
Remove all unnecessary social media and technology tools from your computer, and especially
your smartphone, and replace them with high quality analogue activities like cross-fit, woodworking,
playing the piano, etc. Where will you find the time? You make time by scheduling in
high quality leisure activities into your week. Create a schedule for your work and leisure,
doing so might sound like you are removing spontaneity from your life but it allows you
much more time for living a fulfilling and rewarding life. Just "chilling" is
overrated, not that you never need it, but much less so than you would think. It
can be much more rewarding to work on personal projects and fun difficult activities than
simply just "relaxing".

How do you remove these digital technologies from your life that leech your attention
and time? A 30 day digital detox, make sure to remove all social media from your phone
that you are able to which won't interfere with your work. One of the major things
you will find is that you can batch usage of email, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. into
perhaps no more than once a week or day. Learn to push off things until the time comes
to get it done. Speaking personally, my anxiety and distractability [proper spelling?]
has been significantly reduced after going through this phase and my smartphone usage has
gone way down with minor hiccups. Learn to use the technology, not let it use you.

For the technology you keep after the 30 days make sure to have strict operating procedures
when using it or you will be back to square one. Things like Freedom, StayFocusd, and RescueTime [name??]
helped me limit my low quality browsing on my computer so it is limited to a short period of time per day.
