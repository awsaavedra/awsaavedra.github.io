title: Toughness as a virtue
---

“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.”
~Marcus Aurelius

Perhaps being comfortable is not all it is cracked out to be. What is the obstacle
became the way and the path lay within trial and tribulation? Not the easy route.

A useful heuristic for myself is "What is it that I do not want to do the most?"
If it is something I deem meaningful and important I do that first. Go towards
the pain, towards the discomfort, and many times you will find a better life
at the other end. Suffer for what matters and nothing less.

Toughness seems to be synonymous with "being a man" but often being tough is
stupidity in disguise. I believe in resilience and perseverance towards a worthy
goals, choose where to thread wisely, but do not hesitate once you have chosen
and do not make excuses for failure.

Move on when needed.
