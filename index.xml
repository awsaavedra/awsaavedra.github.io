“If you know the way broadly, you will see it in everything.&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;The way you do anything is the way you do everything.”
~ Miyamoto Musashi
The way is neither simpler nor more complex than this.
It will not be revealed to those who constantly think, not think enough, consider it, wonder whether they have found the way, and especially not those that worry.</description></item><item><title>Disclaimers</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/disclaimers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/disclaimers/</guid><description>Health Disclaimer Medical and health information disclaimer The information provided on this website is for general informational purposes only.

It would be considered a non-contrarian thing to drink.
Yet I rarely see men my age drinking pumpkin spice lattes and they both shun and avoid drinking pumpkin spice to avoid seeming&amp;hellip;whatever.
I would wager the amount of people who actually freely would drink pumpkin spice lattes would increase if it was not a taboo or made fun of.
Since 2005 I have used&amp;hellip;the spice.</description></item><item><title>Documentaries Worth Watching</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/documentaries/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/documentaries/</guid><description>I watched a lot of documentaries, especially of artists and people who are driven into magnificient madness towards something greater than themselves.
“If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends), &amp;ldquo;Am I really a writer? Am I really an artist?&amp;rdquo; chances are you are. The counterfeit innovator is wildly self-confident. The real one is scared to death.”
― Steven Pressfield, The War of Art
Art, especially the greatest of art, is not of utility but an expression of the human spirit.</description></item><item><title>Useless Work</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/useless-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:53:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/useless-work/</guid><description>Busyness is a choice. I choose to get things done, not be busy. Most actions are futile or irrelevant to your goals. Most things you care about are not being taken care of.

Long live us all!” The king’s advisors, like everybody that night, were as happy as children; they embraced each other and congratulated the king: “We did it! We did it!”
But the king answered in a broken voice: “Yes, we did it, we killed the dragon today. But damn, why did we start so late?

“Whenever serious and competent people need to get things done in the real world, all considerations of tradition and protocol fly out the window.” ~ Neal Stephenson
The status quo is taken seriously for many reasons, because most people are conservative in a way that few ever state or articulate completely– This convention, institution, etc. is the right way because it is the way I know best.</description></item><item><title>Enterprising Investor</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/enterprising-investor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 16:38:11 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/enterprising-investor/</guid><description>See the disclaimers for full list of website disclaimers.
Introduction Years ago, I wrote some articles about more passive investment appraoches and financial architecture. This article is about the types of investing strategies that exist, investors in those areas, and some resources for those interested in exploring the enterprise investor space whether it be for academic interest or practical financial reasons.
What is an Enterprise Investor To see if this article is for you let me define what an investor is so you know whether you’re interested in becoming one.</description></item><item><title>Increasing Happiness</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/increasing-happiness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2022 22:57:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/increasing-happiness/</guid><description>The Science of Happiness While taking the science of well being course on coursera I decided to take the course quite seriously. For one, I started without taking any of my baseline assumptions for granted and applied my skepticism as best as I could to &amp;ldquo;commong knowledge&amp;rdquo; ways of looking at happiness.
Overall the course was a good start on a life long journey to find meaning and happiness.</description></item><item><title>Decreasing Consumption, Increasing Happiness</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/decreasing-consumption/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/decreasing-consumption/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time to stop pointing fingers, finger pointing gets us no-where, Steve!&amp;rdquo; ~ Randy Marsh, South Park
In the past year I have reduced my carbon footprint to about 10% that of an average American without much effort. How?
Before telling other people how to live, I have found it is a good idea to examine my life thoroughly first.

For one, I learned the business of forecasting is littered with fake experts and real experts that are easily separable when you put aside most authority and other logical fallacies and simply figure out who can demonstrate their abilities under measurable conditions. In fact, it turns out super forecasters are real and use many reliable techniques to get the job done.</description></item><item><title>Ultralearning</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/ultralearning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2019 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/ultralearning/</guid><description>Background We live in a time when you can go on the internet and read about most things to some level.

Why is it so hard to deal with a bit of boredom or lack of stimulation from our smartphones? The answer goes deeper than many thought.
After going through Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s books: Deep Work and So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You I had to pick up his most recent work on the subject of software technology in our lives.</description></item><item><title>The Intelligent Investor</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/intelligent-investor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/intelligent-investor/</guid><description>Background Around 2014, after being recommended this book by numerous sources, I picked it up and gave it a read. Great books profoundly influence the way you think for the rest of your life. The Intelligent Investor is such a book. It challenged my initial ideas on investment, how to think about assets, and how to think about wealth. Contained within it are sound principles for first preserving what one has and then increase that pile of money safely with time.</description></item><item><title>Deep Work</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/deep-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/deep-work/</guid><description>The Gist that I got:
Create a place or places for deep work free of distraction for extended periods of well defined chunked work that are part of a strong formed habit with daily rituals of getting up and winding down. Each part of your day is segmented. Do not allow distractions or boredom to get in the way. Make sure your outside activities help support deep work meaning you don't extensively used social media, lots of video games, etc--these things train you for consistent attentional switching which is not part of deep work.</description></item><item><title>So Good They Can't Ignore You</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/so-good/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/so-good/</guid><description>Why is Following the Romantic Notion of Passion Bad Advice? I have read many books on productivity but this one stood out to me since the thesis was taking on a central dogma of a large portion of the US society: that following your passion is the key to happiness and fulfillment in the modern world. I have always been skeptical of this hypothesis, but I have not seen a well stated alternative worldview that does not have tremendous downsides.</description></item><item><title>The Originals</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-originals/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-originals/</guid><description>I rarely come away from a book with some solid actionable insights but luckily for me this book had some stellar information and a solid data driven approach to viewing the power of original thinking.
A valuable cognitive strategy I learned from the book is called defensive pessimism which can be defined by wikipedia as:
&amp;quot;When implementing defensive pessimism, individuals set low expectations for their performance, regardless of how well they have done in the past.</description></item><item><title>The Willpower Instinct</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-willpower-instinct/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-willpower-instinct/</guid><description>Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BXuZL1HAg

The basic idea is that a metaskill is a general skill that can be applied to numerous fields and disciplines.
