Copernicus by Stanislaw Szukalski&lt;/p>

Pumpkin spice is considered a very basic drink.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would be considered a non-contrarian thing to drink.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet I rarely see men my age drinking pumpkin spice lattes and they both shun and
avoid drinking pumpkin spice to avoid seeming&amp;hellip;whatever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would wager the amount of people who actually freely would drink pumpkin spice
lattes would increase if it was not a taboo or made fun of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since 2005 I have used&amp;hellip;the spice.
I drink the spice because I like it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Documentaries Worth Watching</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/documentaries/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/documentaries/</guid><description>&lt;p>I watched a lot of documentaries, especially of artists and people who are driven into magnificient madness towards something greater than themselves.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We refer to the question: What sort of creature man’s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be.
We have often heard this debated; but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors;
we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation;
we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that self-regulating,
self-acting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race.
In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.
&amp;hellip;
Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us;
day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily
bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of
their whole lives to the development of mechanical life.
The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines
will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what
no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Seeking Idea Alpha</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/idea-alpha/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 20:02:14 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/idea-alpha/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.&amp;rdquo;

learned the business of forecasting is littered with fake experts
and real experts that are easily separable when you put aside most authority
and other logical fallacies and simply figure out who can demonstrate
their abilities under measurable conditions.
In fact, it turns out super forecasters are real and use many reliable techniques to get

&lt;p>Something is wrong with us now days. Why is it so hard to deal with a bit of boredom or
lack of stimulation from our smartphones? The answer goes deeper than many thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After going through Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s
books: &lt;em>Deep Work&lt;/em> and &lt;em>So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You&lt;/em> I had to pick up his most
recent work on the subject of software technology in our lives.
This book isn&amp;rsquo;t just about getting work done, it is about getting your life
back from companies who want your attention. The business model is clear: increase
your attention on their products and extract more money. One may ask, is this good for
society or is it a net negative for us? In Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s latest book, it is
clear what his answer is: when used how these platforms intend it, it is a net negative
to our health and productivity as individuals. I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend to stay neutral on this
since the evidence is clearer than ever. We need to get these tools under our
control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Intelligent Investor</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/intelligent-investor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/intelligent-investor/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="background">

&lt;p>Around 2014, after being recommended this book by numerous sources, I picked it up and gave it a read. Great books profoundly influence the way you think for the rest of your life. The Intelligent Investor is such a book. It challenged my initial ideas on investment, how to think about assets, and how to think about wealth. Contained within it are sound principles for first preserving what one has and then increase that pile of money safely with time. Benjamin Graham gave me the tools to navigate the waters of finance without making the big mistakes. This is not a book for how to make a quick buck from bitcoin or the next craze or fad. This is a book on careful and conservative thinking in making returns while considering many factors for oneself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deep Work</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/deep-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/deep-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Gist that I got:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Create a place or places for deep work free of distraction for
extended periods of well defined chunked work that are part of a strong
formed habit with daily rituals of getting up and winding down. Each
part of your day is segmented. Do not allow distractions or boredom
to get in the way. Make sure your outside activities help support
deep work meaning you don't extensively used social media, lots of
video games, etc--these things train you for consistent attentional switching
which is not part of deep work.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Before I say anything else, I need you know that I already accept
the premise of this book for myself. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about anyone established and I would prefer to speak to my own experience not
others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>So Good They Can't Ignore You</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/so-good/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/so-good/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="why-is-following-the-romantic-notion-of-passion-bad-advice">

&lt;p>I have read many books on productivity but this one stood out to me since the thesis was taking on a central dogma of a large portion of the US society: that following your passion is the key to happiness and fulfillment in the modern world. I have always been skeptical of this hypothesis, but I have not seen a well stated alternative worldview that does not have tremendous downsides. One of the primary ones I have dealt with is, I am naming it it, the prestige hypothesis which is: get so rich/famous/powerful/etc. that people will respect and like you, then and only then will you be happy and fulfilled. This hypothesis seemed even worse than the passion hypothesis since it makes you a slave to others opinions and does not lead to fulfillment, something many of us yearn for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Originals</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-originals/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-originals/</guid><description>&lt;p>I rarely come away from a book with some solid actionable insights but luckily for me
this book had some stellar information and a solid data driven approach to viewing
the power of original thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A valuable cognitive strategy I learned from the book is called &lt;em>defensive pessimism&lt;/em> which can be defined by wikipedia as:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;quot;When implementing defensive pessimism, individuals set low expectations for their performance,
regardless of how well they have done in the past.

Defensive pessimists then think through specific negative events and setbacks that could adversely
influence their goal pursuits. By envisioning possible negative outcomes, defensive pessimists
can take action to avoid or prepare for them. Using this strategy, defensive pessimists
can advantageously harness anxiety that might otherwise harm their performance.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

shocking data table I saw in the book:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Willpower Instinct</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-willpower-instinct/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-willpower-instinct/</guid><description>&lt;p>Link: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BXuZL1HAg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BXuZL1HAg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Some of you may be aware where I picked up the term “metaskills” from, but I’ll state it anyway: Marty Neumeier’s book _Metaskills: Five Talents for the Robotic Age. _What is a metaskill? The basic idea is that a metaskill is a general skill that can be applied to numerous fields and disciplines. I thought the most important was, of course, the metaskill of all metaskills, learning to learn.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Algorithms to Live By</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/algorithms-to-live-by/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/algorithms-to-live-by/</guid><description>&lt;p>After listening to the 80,000 hours podcast episode 48 I realized that this book was right up my alley and decided it was worth a book review awhile ago but never put it together until now.&lt;/p>
