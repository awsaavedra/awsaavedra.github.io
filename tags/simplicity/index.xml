&lt;p>Something is wrong with us now days. Why is it so hard to deal with a bit of boredom or
lack of stimulation from our smartphones? The answer goes deeper than many thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After going through Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s
books: &lt;em>Deep Work&lt;/em> and &lt;em>So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You&lt;/em> I had to pick up his most
recent work on the subject of software technology in our lives.
This book isn&amp;rsquo;t just about getting work done, it is about getting your life
back from companies who want your attention. The business model is clear: increase
your attention on their products and extract more money. One may ask, is this good for
society or is it a net negative for us? In Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s latest book, it is
clear what his answer is: when used how these platforms intend it, it is a net negative
to our health and productivity as individuals. I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend to stay neutral on this
since the evidence is clearer than ever. We need to get these tools under our
control.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
