&lt;p>We live in a time when you can go on the internet and read about most things
to some level. So can you learning the equivalent to getting an
undergraduate degree from a top university? Scott Young set out on a bold project
of obtaining the equivalent knowledge of an undergraduate Computer Science degree from MIT
in a year. He called this project the MIT Challenge. Did he succeed in this
challenge? Up to you to decide but he did all the projects, homework, and
passed all the final exams of the classes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Digital Minimalism</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/digital-minimalism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/digital-minimalism/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="background">

&lt;p>Something is wrong with us now days. Why is it so hard to deal with a bit of boredom or
lack of stimulation from our smartphones? The answer goes deeper than many thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After going through Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s
books: &lt;em>Deep Work&lt;/em> and &lt;em>So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You&lt;/em> I had to pick up his most
recent work on the subject of software technology in our lives.
This book isn&amp;rsquo;t just about getting work done, it is about getting your life
back from companies who want your attention. The business model is clear: increase
your attention on their products and extract more money. One may ask, is this good for
society or is it a net negative for us? In Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s latest book, it is
clear what his answer is: when used how these platforms intend it, it is a net negative
to our health and productivity as individuals. I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend to stay neutral on this
since the evidence is clearer than ever. We need to get these tools under our
control.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deep Work</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/deep-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/deep-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Gist that I got:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Create a place or places for deep work free of distraction for
extended periods of well defined chunked work that are part of a strong
formed habit with daily rituals of getting up and winding down. Each
part of your day is segmented. Do not allow distractions or boredom
to get in the way. Make sure your outside activities help support
deep work meaning you don't extensively used social media, lots of
video games, etc--these things train you for consistent attentional switching
which is not part of deep work.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Before I say anything else, I need you know that I already accept
the premise of this book for myself. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about anyone established and I would prefer to speak to my own experience not
others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>So Good They Can't Ignore You</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/so-good/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/so-good/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="why-is-following-the-romantic-notion-of-passion-bad-advice">
 Why is Following the Romantic Notion of Passion Bad Advice?

&lt;p>I have read many books on productivity but this one stood out to me since the thesis was taking on a central dogma of a large portion of the US society: that following your passion is the key to happiness and fulfillment in the modern world. I have always been skeptical of this hypothesis, but I have not seen a well stated alternative worldview that does not have tremendous downsides. One of the primary ones I have dealt with is, I am naming it it, the prestige hypothesis which is: get so rich/famous/powerful/etc. that people will respect and like you, then and only then will you be happy and fulfilled. This hypothesis seemed even worse than the passion hypothesis since it makes you a slave to others opinions and does not lead to fulfillment, something many of us yearn for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Originals</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-originals/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-originals/</guid><description>&lt;p>I rarely come away from a book with some solid actionable insights but luckily for me
this book had some stellar information and a solid data driven approach to viewing
the power of original thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A valuable cognitive strategy I learned from the book is called &lt;em>defensive pessimism&lt;/em> which can be defined by wikipedia as:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;quot;When implementing defensive pessimism, individuals set low expectations for their performance,
regardless of how well they have done in the past.

Defensive pessimists then think through specific negative events and setbacks that could adversely
influence their goal pursuits. By envisioning possible negative outcomes, defensive pessimists
can take action to avoid or prepare for them. Using this strategy, defensive pessimists
can advantageously harness anxiety that might otherwise harm their performance.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Before I get into the actionable insights from the book let me point out the most
shocking data table I saw in the book:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Algorithms to Live By</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/algorithms-to-live-by/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/algorithms-to-live-by/</guid><description>&lt;p>After listening to the 80,000 hours podcast episode 48 I realized that this book was right up my alley and decided it was worth a book review awhile ago but never put it together until now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Key Concepts and Algorithms:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Optimal Stopping &amp;ndash; The Secretary Problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Optimal Stopping with full information (Threshold rule). Set a threshold and anyone over that threshold.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Multi-Armed Bandit Problem.&lt;/p>
