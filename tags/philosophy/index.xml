&lt;p>One of the most fascinating things I have dealt with in the world is dealing with people who fundamentally are skeptical of using models for things because they’re not “100% true”.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Criticize by Creating</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/create/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/create/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://awsaavedra.com/create/copernicus.webp"

Copernicus by Stanislaw Szukalski&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The moment he [Galileo] was set at liberty, he looked up to the sky and down to the ground, and, stamping with his foot, in a contemplative mood, said, Eppur si muove, that is, still it moves, meaning the Earth.&amp;rdquo; ~ Giuseppe Baretti retelling 1757&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To create is human, to consume is only tiny part of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somewhere along the way we started
being referred to as consumers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pumpkin Spice Lattes</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/pumpkin/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 21:13:48 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/pumpkin/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://awsaavedra.com/pumpkin/caffeine.webp"

Pumpkin spice is considered a very basic drink.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would be considered a non-contrarian thing to drink.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet I rarely see men my age drinking pumpkin spice lattes and they both shun and
avoid drinking pumpkin spice to avoid seeming&amp;hellip;whatever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would wager the amount of people who actually freely would drink pumpkin spice
lattes would increase if it was not a taboo or made fun of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since 2005 I have used&amp;hellip;the spice.
I drink the spice because I like it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Useless Work</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/useless-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 15:53:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/useless-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>Busyness is a choice.
I choose to get things done, not be busy.
Most actions are futile or irrelevant to your goals.
Most things you care about are not being taken care of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I can’t help but wonder whether all this histrionic exhaustion isn’t a way of covering up the fact that most of what we do doesn’t matter.” –Tim Kreider&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you want to get things done or be busy? Choose wisely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Longevity Forever</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/longevity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 20:55:20 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/longevity/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The joy cry resolved into a jubilating chant: “Long live the king! Long live us all!” The king’s advisors, like everybody that night, were as happy as children; they embraced each other and congratulated the king: “We did it! We did it!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the king answered in a broken voice: “Yes, we did it, we killed the dragon today. But damn, why did we start so late? This could have been done five, maybe ten years ago! Millions of people wouldn’t have had to die.” ~Nick Bostrom, The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/ai/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 16:39:08 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/ai/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We refer to the question: What sort of creature man’s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be.
We have often heard this debated; but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors;
we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation;
we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that self-regulating,
self-acting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race.
In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.
&amp;hellip;
Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us;
day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily
bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of
their whole lives to the development of mechanical life.
The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines
will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what
no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Seeking Idea Alpha</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/idea-alpha/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jan 2025 20:02:14 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/idea-alpha/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.&amp;rdquo;

&lt;p>“Whenever serious and competent people need to get things done in the real world, all considerations of tradition and protocol fly out the window.” ~ Neal Stephenson&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The status quo is taken seriously for many reasons, because most people are conservative in a way that few ever state or articulate completely– This convention, institution, etc. is the right way because it is the way I know best. To find a better way of doing things is often unimaginable on sometimes the smallest scale. “Why would someone put the toilet paper roll that way?”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enterprising Investor</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/enterprising-investor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 16:38:11 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/enterprising-investor/</guid><description>&lt;p>See the &lt;a href="https://awsaavedra.com/disclaimers/">disclaimers&lt;/a> for full list of website disclaimers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Years ago, I wrote some &lt;a href="https://awsaavedra.com/tags/finance/">articles&lt;/a> about more passive investment appraoches and financial architecture. This article is about the types of investing strategies that exist, investors in those areas, and some resources for those interested in exploring the enterprise investor space whether it be for academic interest or practical financial reasons.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
