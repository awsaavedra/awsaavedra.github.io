One of the most fascinating things I have dealt with in the world is dealing with people who fundamentally are skeptical of using models for things because they’re not “100% true”.
It’s an interesting premise because it shows such a profoundly ignorant understanding of epistemology.
All models are false, but some are useful since they’re approximations of the truth.
One good example is “cows are spheres” is a good model for certain physics problems because it is easier than dealing with the complexity of an actual cow and is approximately correct.</description></item></channel></rss>
