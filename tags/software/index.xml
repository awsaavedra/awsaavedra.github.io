&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We refer to the question: What sort of creature man’s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be.
We have often heard this debated; but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors;
we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation;
we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that self-regulating,
self-acting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race.
In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.
&amp;hellip;
Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us;
day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily
bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of
their whole lives to the development of mechanical life.
The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines
will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what
no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
