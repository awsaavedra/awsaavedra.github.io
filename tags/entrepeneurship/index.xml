Copernicus by Stanislaw Szukalski&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;The moment he [Galileo] was set at liberty, he looked up to the sky and down to the ground, and, stamping with his foot, in a contemplative mood, said, Eppur si muove, that is, still it moves, meaning the Earth.&amp;rdquo; ~ Giuseppe Baretti retelling 1757&lt;/p>

Pumpkin spice is considered a very basic drink.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would be considered a non-contrarian thing to drink.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet I rarely see men my age drinking pumpkin spice lattes and they both shun and
avoid drinking pumpkin spice to avoid seeming&amp;hellip;whatever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would wager the amount of people who actually freely would drink pumpkin spice
lattes would increase if it was not a taboo or made fun of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since 2005 I have used&amp;hellip;the spice.
I drink the spice because I like it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
