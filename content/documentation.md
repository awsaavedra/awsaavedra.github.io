# The Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is a primary list of areas I have documented over time for help with various areas of lifestyle design. When I say lifestyle design I try to answer the question "how to design a life worth living and optimized to my needs?" I assume many people struggle with similar problems to myself and that the same solutions that have worked for me are useful to others. This is not simply a list of areas of study, it is a web of knowledge to thread together over time to help others and myself become more effective. 

“argued, I think, very plausibly, that the core principle and requirement of a fulfilled human being is the ability to inquire and create constructively, independently, without external controls.” A true education, Chomsky suggests, opens a door to human intellectual freedom and creative autonomy." ~ paraphrasing Wilhelm von Humboldt by Noam Chomsky

“glorify who you are today, do not condemn who you were yesterday and dream of who you can be tomorrow...” ~ Neale Donald Walsch

The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question. ```
