## Why use models?

One of the most fascinating things I have dealt with in the world is dealing with people who fundamentally are skeptical of using models for things because they’re not “100% true”.

It’s an interesting premise because it shows such a profoundly ignorant understanding of epistemology.

All models are false, but some are useful since they’re approximations of the truth.

One good example is “cows are spheres” is a good model for certain physics problems because it is easier than dealing with the complexity of an actual cow and is approximately correct. This approximation is useful for learning problems for new physics students to learn the procedures and methodologies of learning mathematical and physical techniques for classrooms.

Should we only use the closest approximation to the ground truth because it is more true? Now you have two problems instead of one.

My intuition is that this is similar to the [Lumpers and splitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpers_and_splitters) issue in the sense that people who want ground truth suffer from a fundamental conceptual error. 

The map is not the territory, but without a map you’re pretty screwed getting anywhere.

The folks that don’t believe or don’t understand models' usefulness are skeptical of how good models cannot participate in a shared understanding of the world on numerous levels.

One such level is “the earth is round” is roughly correct enough to be a useful fact, but perhaps they find out it is ever so different. Instead of updating their understanding they use binary logic: if it is not 100% true then it must be false.

All proper epistemology is based on understanding the weakness of the mind to fully understand all aspects of the universe in all its complexity. This means we, at best, will asymptotically approach truth.

When scientifically and mathematically literate people tend to argue with these people without a proper debate or philosophical background they make a fundamental error of assuming these peoples premises are all the same as theirs. Instead they could start with basic premises or ask questions like “what would it take to convince you that X or Y is true?” This, at minimum, induces the person to think and potentially reveal their stated epistemology. Notice “stated epistemology” as their real epistemology would need to be tested in practice not in principle. 

One of the most interesting ones is sophists who don’t believe in shared intersubjective (or objective) morals and objective truth. The replacement is moral nihilism/relativism and subjectivism. The subjectivism though frequently isn’t consistent as following this logic to its conclusions would yield purely a belief that the only knowable fact is that that their consciousness exists and the universe around them could be some sort of dream. The simulation hypothesis, but they never actually believe this in practice similar to one of the few moral nihilists to live is GG Allen. The man who makes Marilyn Manson look like a boyscout. 

It’s similar to people who expect a human to be consistent vs optimally hypocritical for their evolutionary niche. These people are twice wrong because they don’t understand what kinds of minds evolution would produce, and then are shocked that those said minds don’t optimize on truth in general.

Rare is a mind that optimizes for truth just like it is risky as well. Truth tells and seekers in most societies that have ever existed are usually in danger. Don’t shoot the messenger is a saying for a reason.

## Why not use models?

There are reasons, but the target becomes the goal.
People confuse measurement for the real thing in general.
Sometimes “I don’t know and I need to keep looking” is more intellectually honest. 
The list continues.

# Pre/Current/Post Modelers
There are three types of modelers which are the pre-modelers as we just discussed who have a flabby epistemology.
The second is the modelers who, if they’re extremely obtuse or dogmatic, fall for the notion that the map is indeed the territory.
The last group is the post-modelers who are the wisest of the three that understand models are correct up to a limit. However, they also are quiet similar to post-quantitative people who understand that numbers, models, and the like cannot fully represent the world.
Although, if we are wise and numerate, we are usually shockingly accurate. So accurate in fact that there seems to something [unreasonably effective about mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences) .

For the religious scientist mathematics can be an expression of the nature of God. For the non-religious amongst us the abstract nature of truth, beauty, or other characteristics of the universe. The austerity of mathematics is also something to understand and admire, for the general flabby and formlessness of most languages makes its reach quite short in terms of modeling capabilities and predictions. 

I rather be roughly correct than precisely wrong. 
Which is precisely what dogmatic modelers or mathematical dogmatists are falsely 
claim to have.

Direct quote "There is a more plausible explanation of this barrage of should's.
The reality we live in is constituted by a myriad contradictions, which
traditional philosophy has taken pains to describe with courageous
realism. But **contradiction cannot be confronted by minds who have
put their salvation in precision and definitiveness.** The real world is
filled with absences, with absurdities, with abnormalities, with aberrances, 
with abominations, with abuses, with Abgrund. But our latter-
day philosophers are not concerned with facing up to these unpleasant
features of the world, nor, to be sure, to any real features whatsoever.
**They would rather tell us what the world should be like.** They find it
safer to escape from distasteful description of what is into pointless
prescription of what isn't. Like ostriches with their heads in the ground,
they will meet the fate of those who refuse to acknowledge the lessons
of the past and to meet the challenge of our difficult present: 
increasing irrelevancy followed by eventual extinction."
