## 🌙 Sleep (22:00 - 6:00)

Rest and recovery period.

# Below this line some some key decision filters I used

## 0. Can I actually follow the routine? 

If it's perfectly effective but nearly impossible to follow it's meaningless.
  
a. Consider pareto optional frontiers for all decisions. 
  
b. If you don't know what that is learn it, because I bet you're unaware of things like
  game theory in practice, normative decision making, and things like that.

c. Can I follow this routine and modify it effectively in the long run?

## 1. Am I still productive in other areas of my life or is this all consuming? 
If it is all consuming it's a waste of time and won't be followed.


## Heuristics Used here 
0. Whole Foods over processed
1. Plant sources over animal sources
2. Slightly Cooked (microwaved, raw, lightly steamed) over heavily cooked
3. Apply the 80-20 rule to diet, try to eat the big winners first
4. Environmental Design, remove temptation items instead of resisting them
5. Moderation–if you’re too strict you will just relapse
6. Expensive and/or complicated health solutions should be viewed with skepticism, 
where is the scientific evidence to support it? 
Is it more effective than the less expensive version–if so, how much more effective?
7. Doctor’s are just people, they make mistakes too–be an advocate for your own health and ask them informed and well researched questions
8. Scientific evidence over subjective experience
9. Variety over quantity, rotating through foods to maximize nutrient spread in a reasonable range.

## Contaminants & Packaging Checklist

**Goal:** Minimize avoidable toxins (heavy metals, plastics, pesticides) without obsession.
**Use:** When evaluating high-risk categories (tea, spices, supplements, fish).

### 1. Risk Screen: Is this a "Bio-Accumulator"?
*If yes, apply strict scrutiny (COAs, sourcing).*
- [ ] **Tea/Matcha** (Lead/Fluoride accumulator)
- [ ] **Spices** (Root/seed accumulators: Turmeric, Ginger, Cumin)
- [ ] **Chocolate/Cocoa** (Cadmium/Lead accumulator)
- [ ] **Rice** (Arsenic accumulator)
- [ ] **Leafy Greens/Roots** (Soil uptake)
- [ ] **Predatory Fish** (Mercury accumulator: Tuna, Swordfish)
- [ ] **Supplements** (Concentrated sources)

### 2. Packaging & Microplastics
*Heat + Plastic = Leaching. Avoid.*
- [ ] **No hot contact with plastic:** No plastic kettles, coffee pods, or tea bags (nylon/mesh).
- [ ] **Safe Materials:** Glass, Stainless Steel, Ceramic, Cast Iron.
- [ ] **Tea:** Loose-leaf preferred. If bagged, unbleached paper only (no "silken" plastic).
- [ ] **Acidic Foods:** Buy tomato/citrus in glass jars, not cans (BPA/BPS lining risk).

### 3. Heavy Metals (The "Prove It" Check)
*Marketing claims ("Clean", "Tested") mean nothing. Numbers matter.*
- [ ] **COA Verification:** Does the brand share a recent 3rd-party Certificate of Analysis?
- [ ] **Units Matter:** Look for **ppb** (parts per billion), NOT ppm.
    - *Red Flag:* "ND at 0.5 ppm" (Detection limit is too high; hides contamination).
- [ ] **Ideal Thresholds:**
    - Lead < 5 ppb
    - Arsenic/Cadmium/Mercury < 10–50 ppb (context dependent)
- [ ] **No COA?** Treat as "high risk" if it's a bio-accumulator category.

### 4. Sourcing & Farming
- [ ] **Organic:** Prioritize for "Dirty Dozen" (Berries, Leafy Greens, Apples, Peppers).
- [ ] **Geography:** "Packed in USA" ≠ "Grown in USA". Look for specific region of origin.
- [ ] **Rice:** Rinse thoroughly. Rotate grains (Quinoa, Oats) to lower arsenic load.
- [ ] **Fish:** Small > Large (Sardines/Salmon > Tuna).

### 5. Supplements (Trust but Verify)
- [ ] **Certification:** NSF Certified for Sport OR USP Verified? (Gold Standard).
- [ ] **Proprietary Blends:** Avoid. (Hides dosage/fillers).
- [ ] **Fillers:** Minimal inactive ingredients. No titanium dioxide or artificial colors.

### 6. Process Contaminants (Cooking)
- [ ] **Golden Rule:** Cook to golden, not brown/charred (Acrylamide/PAHs reduction).
- [ ] **Methods:** Steam/Microwave/Bake > Deep Fry/Char-Grill.
- [ ] **Oils:** Use high smoke point oils (Avocado, Ghee) for heat; EVOO for finishing.
