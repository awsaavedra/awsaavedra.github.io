# Win the Interview Game


My first major assumption is you want an elite role where you do exceptional work that matters to civilization. **If you are looking for a typical engineering role without high impact or simply another profitable company stop reading now. I respect your time and mine. This isn't the right blog post for you.** Pure profit is not the motivator for the people reading this who will resonate with this role. You are looking for

    1. Highly dynamic and creative work

    2. A massive transformative purpose or decade long pursuit worthy of changing lives https://www.diamandis.com/mtp

    3. You are looking for a life mission, not a job

So I admit the title is corny and the job market fluctuates a lot so I decided it was worth writing some advice down since a lot of my friends 
and old coworkers are going through layoffs or quitting with little success at finding a new job.

In the case I interview in the future and a company is like "I know your tricks!" They might easily realize, actually, 
these aren't tricks just a how to manual and if you just give people reasonable terms and 
offers negotiation might not be part of the process. 
Haggling wastes everyones time, especially haggling 
when referencing bad data on what an employee is worth.

This article will be broken down into three parts.

0. **Why should I listen to you?**

1. **Create a pipeline** funnel of interested companies

2. **Rounds** getting through the rounds (at a high level)

3. **Get the Ideal Offer** how to get the offer you want

I will not be providing the typical "how to apply advice" because it isn't a sufficiently interesting.

I also have a background in market economics, it is a passion and a hobby. 
I spared technical economic jargon but you are dealing with a two sided market place 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-sided_market with you trading your skills and time. 
You might be surprised how much an economics backgrounds helps understand market dynamics.

# 0. Why Should I listen to You?

I am an engineer who has interviewed 100s of candidates for technical jobs over 
the years and vetted candidates for elite technology roles at a Stanford founded startup that was acquired. 
The recruiter I primarily worked with was a top recruiter at at a fortune 100 company 
and widely considered one of the best recruiters in industry. 
One of the other recruiters was also a top Computer Science student turned recruiter.

In addition, I have worked as a technical and interview coach for years helping people
 land jobs at top technology companies and elite startups. 
 I charge for these services and people pay me up to 3 digits an hour 
 as well if market signals matter to you.

# 1. Create Pipeline

This seems like the most trivial piece, but it is actually the most important 
and done wrong by many people. The best way to create pipeline is make yourself 
interesting, the best jobs would never hire someone who only submitted a resume. 
The most interesting work will get in touch with you because you're already doing 
interesting things that are high value to them. Many times, the application is a 
formality since there are only a small number of qualified candidates.

This is counter intuitive to many people. My best advice on brute force applications is don't do it 
if you're a mid and late career professional because you will be wasting your time or pull up.

For new grads, references, alumni networks, coding competitions, a website or portfolio of work, citations in prestigious journals, meetup groups, 
and many other strategies will help you more than mass applying.

My first piece of advice for those without the proper skills is "get them or 
find something else if it isn't within your capacity." 
I don't believe in fake it until you make it, but I do believe in imposter syndrome.

Naval Ravikant said 
"The world rewards you for creating things it doesn't know how to get for itself."

Puffery is not a substitute for real skill that can be measured and only obtained through hard effort. I have posts on productivity https://awsaavedra.com/tags/productivity/ if you are so inclined to boost skills or want a framework on the topic of productivity.

Once you have the appropriate skills you can create the marketing and branding surrounding them. In particular, I would recommend a website or some competition boards where it can be clear you've achieved a SMART goal, Specific Measure Assignable Realistic and Time-related. Create ways to be accountable to these goals. Hackerrank, top laboratory awards, or research under a highly regarded professional in your field will do the trick. Find a competition worth pursuing or a project worth achieving before ever considering whether or not it will enhance your resume.

For instance

If you are really having trouble getting in front of the right people, you can try reverse recruiting by contacting recruiters and asking "what do I need to stand out?" At worst, they won't reply, but if they do with specific advice of books and materials to read from the specific team you are on it stacks the odds in your favor.

## 2. Making the Rounds

Each company is different, but one thing is always the same, they will make you talk to a ton of people over an extended period of time. A lot of company subscribe to the philosophy of "interview slowly, fire quickly." 

Some of these things you can be prepared for like asking to know who you will be interviewing with, maybe what topics to brush up on, and what they might ask, but the biggest edge is knowing how you will contribute to the organization by understanding what they do and how you can help them achieve these goals more effectively than anyone else.
Sometimes companies simply hire because someone has the right experience, but if you are exceptional you can overcome this by showing that experience is always second to talent and effective hard work. Any reasonable hiring manager knows this, all other things being equal.

Every interview you end not getting to the end run a post-mortem and try to get feedback if they are open to it. This can be difficult, but understanding if it was just noise or signal is important for you to grow in your skills at interview. Interviewing is a skill.

One major thing is that when providing a story it should have the following components:

    1. Beginning, a story setup

    2. Middle which includes actions, steps taken, challenges faced

    3. A positive end showing the outcome and qualitative or quantitative results

You must learn to grok properties of the ideal candidate they are looking for.

If they read your blog(s) or academic papers that can only help you.
