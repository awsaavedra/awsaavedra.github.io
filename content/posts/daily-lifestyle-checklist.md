lifestyle over the past couple years based on the latest scientific evidence. Not something to be followed without consulting a doctor.

## Supplements

https://nutritionfacts.org/2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/

1. Algae oil (250mg+)

2. Vitamin b12 

3. Vitamin D (or go in the sun 30+ mins)

4. Calcium

5. Iodine supplements (or seaweed)
  - dulse seaweed
  - nori seaweed

6. Selenium (or brazil nuts)

  - I have not found any sufficient food source besides brazil nuts that tastes alright

7. Iron 

  - chocolate
  - spinach
  - legumes
  - pumpkin seeds
  - quinoa
  - broccoli

## Nutritional Heuristics

1) Plant sources over animal sources
2) Slightly Cooked (microwaved, raw, lightly steamed) over heavily cooked
3) Apply the 80-20 rule to diet, try to eat the big winners first
4) Remove temptation items instead of resisting them
5) Moderation--if you're too strict you will just relapse
6) Expensive and/or complicated health solutions should be viewed with skepticism, where is the scientific evidence to support it? 
Is it more effective than the less expensive version--if so, how much more effective?
7) Doctor's are just people, they make mistakes too--be an advocate for your own health 
and ask them informed and well researched questions
8) Scientific evidence over subjective experience

## Longevity
Below the fold, can you extend your life much further? The above are behavioral factors mostly, the path forward is to drastically increase
our healthspan--I say healthspan because increasing lifespan only does not seem like a good use of resources.

1. Lifespan by David Sinclair

2. Zeno-Hormesis

3. Exosomes: https://worldhealth.net/news/why-exosomes-over-stem-cells/

4. Engineering people or children: Yamakaka factors

5. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenohormesis

6. Senolytic: drugs that kill off senescent cells

7. NAD boosters-- NMN, resveritol (fix spelling later), NR molecule is cheaper and I'm not sure about which ones more effective. I'd go with the cheaper one, that's my POV though.

8. Hot and cold triggers hormonal responses. I prefer cold b.c it increases the amount of brown fat you have + Other things. The temperature differential being large helps along with things just being cold. The book goes over this more. The general principle is stressing the body under controlled conditions produces huge postive results.

9. Fasting during the day. So no eating at night until lunch or later. Only liquids like water and tea. No milk, smoothies, etc. (I don't practice this yet, I'm still figuring out how to incorporate it). What's the best strategy for fasting? TBD.

10. Hormesis effect: some stress on the system, not too much, will increase longevity

11. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayflick_limit
Can we make cells immortal? 

12. https://wiki.opencog.org/w/Patternism I am not my cells, nor my brain, I am the emergent pattern that forms from all these interactions.
You are not your brain, you are the result of your brain. This is not just a subtle difference.
