Pumpkin spice is considered a very basic drink.

It would be considered a non-contrarian thing to drink.

Yet I rarely see men my age drinking pumpkin spice lattes and they both shun and
avoid drinking pumpkin spice to avoid seeming...whatever.

I would wager the amount of people who actually freely would drink pumpkin spice 
lattes would increase if it was not a taboo or made fun of.

Since 2005 I have used...the spice. 
I drink the spice because I like it.

I have also noticed in the 20 years of drinking them every decade someone 
has given me shit for it.

I will continue to drink them because I like them.

The problem with terms like contrarian and "counter culture" is they are defined
by the culture.

The hardest thing, and the rarest, is to do what you love and like what you like 
independent of societies expectations.

This applies to both pumpkin spice lattes and life.

Each September I wait for the spice.

The spice is nice.

The spice must flow.
