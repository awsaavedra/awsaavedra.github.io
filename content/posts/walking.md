![The Way](/the-way.webp "The Way")

The way is revealed only to those that walk it.

“If you know the way broadly, you will see it in everything." 

"The way you do anything is the way you do everything.”

 ~ Miyamoto Musashi

The way is neither simpler nor more complex than this.

It will **not** be revealed to those who constantly think, not think enough, 
consider it, wonder whether they have found the way, and especially not those that worry.

The way will only be revealed by those open to the way and vision is not clouded by prejudice.

Both vision and sight beyond sight.

The way is revealed in the inner stillness of the soul as they walk the path.

This is the way.

Wei wu wei.
