## Me

My massive transformative purpose is: __to democratize secure and safe AI technologies__

I focus on productivity over connectivity.
I focus on positive sum games in life; we win and then help others win.

If I had to summarize myself in three words it would be to **tell the truth**, if I had three more it would be **all the time**<sub>1</sub>. If I was given four quotes it would be these:

1. Courage, because without it no other virtues can stand<sub>2</sub>.
2. I believe that the free, exploring mind of the individual is the most valuable thing in the world<sub>3</sub>.
3. If I cannot lower the heavens, I will raise hell<sub>4</sub>.
4. For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it<sub>5</sub>.

## Three Virtues of a Programmer

According to Larry Wall, the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris. This is a joke.

**Laziness**: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.

**Impatience**: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.

**Hubris**: The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about.
