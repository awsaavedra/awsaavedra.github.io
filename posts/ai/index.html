<p>We refer to the question: What sort of creature man’s next successor in the supremacy of the earth is likely to be.
We have often heard this debated; but it appears to us that we are ourselves creating our own successors;
we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical organisation;
we are daily giving them greater power and supplying by all sorts of ingenious contrivances that self-regulating,
self-acting power which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race.
In the course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race.
&mldr;
Day by day, however, the machines are gaining ground upon us;
day by day we are becoming more subservient to them; more men are daily
bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of
their whole lives to the development of mechanical life.
The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines
will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what
no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.
~ Darwin among the Machines by Cellarius (Samuel Butler)</p>
<p>I remember reading this quote and wondering when this was written.</p>
<p>Can you guess without looking this up? At the end of this I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p>
<p>When dealing with AI timelines it&rsquo;s been a wild ride realizing back in 2007 that the
age of machines was upon us. Whether we will be economically relevant as a species is
a fascinating subject with many perspectives.</p>
<p>As we get closer to the singularity many questions will be asked about science, philosophy, and our economic relevancy as a species. The <strong>singularity</strong> is a point at which is when technological progress cannot be understood
by current human mind since it is progressing so quickly. The only way to get around
this is to increase our speed of understanding by enhancing our own intelligence
via numerous methods that will expand our neo-cortex many fold.</p>
<p>Humans are becoming cyborgs. What&rsquo;s the difference between an android and cyborg
is not as interesting of a question as whether all computations can be equivalent
regardless of the hardware performing it. The mind can be viewed as a series of patterns
and I view patternism as the best attempt as understanding these patterns.</p>
<p>In addition, the type of hardware running these patterns is largely irrelevant.
The reason why is because if these computations are equivalent then the substance of the
computation is the same. This view is called <strong>computational equivalence</strong> in which
as long as both systems can perform the same computations then they&rsquo;re equivalent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to convince the reader that humans are unique in our mental processes
quiet the opposite. I would argue we inhabit an interesting branch of the evolutionary tree
however it is definitely possible to replicate in a machine mind.</p>
<h1 id=objections-to-these-ideas>Objections to these ideas</h1>
<p><img src=/ai/only-humans.png alt="Only Human" title="Only human"></p>
<p>There are numerous objections to all of these ideas but one is that these computations
human brains do is NOT equivalent to AI. This is completely false from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>Another one is the AIs are not embodied, which is a valid criticism. How long will
this fact stay true though? Not long as robotics advanced.</p>
<p>The other arguments break down to what Scott Aaronson called &ldquo;Justaism&rdquo; arguments like
the following:</p>
<pre><code>1. AI is just a stoicastic parrot
2. AI is just a next work completion device
</code></pre>
<p>I could go on but as Scott states &ldquo;what the justaism arguers always fail to realize
is all these arguments apply to us (humans)&rdquo;.</p>
<h1 id=will-machines-be-conscious>Will machines be conscious?</h1>
<p>This is a complex philosophical topic and I will only state a couple things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The only completely knowable fact to you is that you&rsquo;re conscious</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is unknowable with present technology to know if another being is conscious. It&rsquo;s just an assumption others being are albeit a good one!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should use the same standards of evidence we use for other people, animals, etc. to
apply to AI to decide it is conscious.</p>
<ul>
<li>AI tools like large language models have passed the turing test already and
almost no one paid attention</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id=how-long-until-we-get-machines-as-smart-as-us>How long until we get machines as smart as us?</h1>
<p><img src=/ai/benchmarks.png alt=benchmarks title=Benchmarking></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the real question that matters, the possibilities is inevitable assuming we keep
progressing and I&rsquo;m fairly certain it will happen in the next 5 year.
As smart as an average person as least.</p>
<p>Since it is an exponential trend it will surpass the whole of humanity as some point
and what then? I don&rsquo;t know, but very soon in the next 10-20 years at most, I think 2040 to 2045 is conservative.</p>
<h1 id=science-fiction-and-potential-science-fact-scenarios>Science fiction and potential science fact scenarios</h1>
<p>I wrote a blog post about perspectives on progress in which I covered possible
future scenarios humans may face. The major one we are currently facing
is one in which bits, as opposed to atoms, are experiencing exponential progress.
At this point it is an undeniable fact that machine intelligence is progressing
faster than most expected. Back in 1999 when Ray Kurzweil wrote The Age of Spiritual
Machines and predict artificial general intelligence by 2029 the AI community got
together and came up with 100+ year timeline to reach AGI. His position was highly controversial but
he was clearly potentially producing <strong>idea alpha</strong> much like I discussed previously.</p>
<p>Many possibilities exist but one of them is from the short SciFi story The Machine Stops
by E.M. Forster. In this world we are completely depend on the machines for everything.</p>
<p>Another one of the Age of Em by Rob Hanson is which the primary humans who are
still economically relevant are synthetic humans who exist in digital cities or
completely virtually.</p>
<p>Another short story is I, Robot.
This was also made into a movie in which the machines
decided the maximally efficient solution for humans to remain unharmed was to keep
them isolated and under a panopticon. A panopticon is a prison in which everyone
is being monitored at all times and disciplined for any transgression.</p>
<p>The Positronic Man by Asimov is story covering which covers numerous topics most importantly
to me the chauvinism of humanity. It was later turned into the movie Bicenntial Man with Robin Williams.</p>
<p>As Robert Sapolsky said with extreme sarcasm &ldquo;For all creatures are unique, but humans
are the unique-est.&rdquo;
What Sapolsky is getting at is that humans have the delusion they are the most
important organism from an objective and cosmic perspective when in fact they are not.
There is no objective reason to say this is the case.
It is a case of value constellations in which we&rsquo;ve selected our own biased
value system to decided that a certain configuration of values matter most.
Why? Simply because they matter the most to us. Pure conceited arguments
for our own perspective. If bees in our position and highly intelligent
honey making would probably be high on the list. You may chuckle but
it is equally as ridiculous to select whatever constellation of values you&rsquo;ve
chosen.
All values are contextual and instrumental to the goals used.
There may be universal values but that&rsquo;s a tough one to argue for.</p>
<p>Another movie</p>
<h1 id=what-do-you-see-in-the-sloggoth>What do you see in the Sloggoth?</h1>
<p>There are many descriptions of the concept of a Sloggoth, my favorite is this one
It was a terrible, indescribable thing vaster than any subway train—a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and un-forming as pustules of greenish light all over the tunnel-filling front that bore down upon us, crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.</p>
<p>— H. P. Lovecraft, At the Mountains of Madness</p>
<p><img src=/ai/rorschach-sloggoth.png alt=rorscach title=rorschach></p>
<p>Besides being supposedly menacing it is a hodge podge of things while being nothing in particular.
Similar to a rorschach test you&rsquo;re making meaning out of a muddled image.
People see what their prejudices allow and create meaning everywhere there.</p>
<h1 id=resources-for-learning-more-about-machine-learning>Resources for learning more about Machine Learning</h1>
