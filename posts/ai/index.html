The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines

no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>~ Darwin among the Machines by Cellarius (Samuel Butler)</p><p>I remember reading this quote and wondering when this was written.</p><p>Can you guess without looking this up? At the end of this I&rsquo;ll tell you.</p><p>When dealing with AI timelines it&rsquo;s been a wild ride realizing back in 2007 that the
age of machines was upon us. Whether we will be economically relevant as a species is
a fascinating subject with many perspectives.</p><p>As we get closer to the singularity many questions will be asked about science, philosophy, and our economic relevancy as a species.
The <strong>singularity</strong> is a point at which is when technological progress cannot be understood
by current human mind since it is progressing so quickly.
The only way to get around
this is to increase our speed of understanding by enhancing our own intelligence
via numerous methods that will expand our neo-cortex many fold.</p><p>Humans are becoming cyborgs. What&rsquo;s the difference between an android and cyborg
is not as interesting of a question as whether all computations can be equivalent
regardless of the hardware performing it. The mind can be viewed as a series of patterns
and I view patternism as the best attempt as understanding these patterns.</p><p>In addition, the type of hardware running these patterns is largely irrelevant.
The reason why is because if these computations are equivalent then the substance of the
computation is the same.
This view is called <strong>computational equivalence</strong> in which
as long as both systems can perform the same computations then they&rsquo;re equivalent.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not going to try to convince the reader that humans are unique in our mental processes
quiet the opposite.
I would argue we inhabit an interesting branch of the evolutionary tree
however it is definitely possible to replicate in a machine mind.</p><h1 id=objections-to-these-ideas>Objections to these ideas

human brains do is NOT equivalent to AI.
This is completely false from a technical perspective.
If the computations are indistinguishable from one another in terms of function
how then can we know the substance of the computation is not equivalent?
Performing a deeper equality test gets harder and harder as you go down this chain of reasoning.</p><p>Another one is the AIs are not embodied, which is a valid criticism.
How long will this fact stay true though?
Not long as robotics advanced.</p><p>The other arguments break down to what Scott Aaronson called &ldquo;Justaism&rdquo; arguments like
the following:</p><pre><code>1. AI is just a stoicastic parrot
2. AI is just a next work completion device
</code></pre><p>I could go on but as Scott states &ldquo;what the justaism arguers always fail to realize
is all these arguments apply to us (humans)&rdquo;.</p><p>A very historically minded objection would be that the field of AI
made this same claim awhile ago and got it extremely wrong which I will address below.</p><h1 id=ai-winter-of-the-80s>AI Winter of the 80s

Economically,
men will retain their greatest comparative advantage in jobs that require flexible manipulation of those parts of the environment
that are relatively rough—some forms of manual work, control of some kinds of machinery (e.g., operating earth-moving equipment),
some kinds of nonprogrammed problem solving, and some kinds of service activities
where face-to-face human interaction is of the essence.” ~ 1960, The New Science of Management Decision by Herbert A. Simon</p><p>Back in the 70s and 80s people were wrongly predicting that the AIs would surpass humans that decade.</p><p>The two schools of research were expert systems and the connectionist school.
The connectionists used the brain for inspiration and the expert systems used more formal logic for inspiration.
From the Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy it states that
“Connectionism is a movement in cognitive science that hopes to explain intellectual abilities
using artificial neural networks (also known as “neural networks” or “neural nets”).”
Expert systems use formal logic structures that proved to be very brittle.
One of the most famous expert systems was a set of incredibly nested and
convoluted conditional statements e.g. &ldquo;if else&rdquo; (spaghetti code?) that become so hard to maintain almost all
changes made after a certain point broke the program.</p><p>The majority of universities and research groups bet on the expert systems side and some on the connectionist side.
The lack of progress on both fronts created the AI winter.
The few places that did continue on the connectionist side eventually bore fruit of course.
Numerous factors contributed to this but the most obvious was overpromising and under delivering.
Especially since numerous researchers expected a generally intelligent system by 1980 or so.</p><p>These connectionist researchers are now incredibly famous such as Geoffrey Hinton.
Places like University of Toronto who produced the likes of Ilya Sutskever stuck it out when connectionism seemed implausible.</p><p>The opposite of “this time is different" is “it is always the same."
Sometimes things are indeed different, <strong>my central claim is that this time is indeed different</strong>.</p><p>People measure things by time instead of events.
This is a bad idea when to use time based terms “sometimes a century can happen in a day."
The amount of paradigm shifting events will increase. Buckle up.
A better measurement is change which is the the number of events happening over a given time interval.</p><p>Humans&rsquo; intuitions are linear but information technology is exponential.
When people project the growth they are deceived at first by the exponential as
it looks flat or barely growing but increases drastically.</p><h1 id=will-machines-be-conscious>Will machines be conscious?

and what then?
I don&rsquo;t know, but very soon in the next 10-20 years at most, I think 2040 to 2045 is conservative.

future scenarios humans may face.
The major one we are currently facing
is one in which bits, as opposed to atoms, are experiencing exponential progress.
At this point it is an undeniable fact that machine intelligence is progressing
faster than most expected.
Back in 1999 when Ray Kurzweil wrote The Age of Spiritual
Machines and predict artificial general intelligence by 2029 the AI community got
together and came up with 100+ year timeline to reach AGI.
His position was highly controversial but
he was clearly potentially producing <strong>idea alpha</strong> much like I discussed previously.</p><p>Many possibilities exist but one of them is from the short SciFi story The Machine Stops
by E.M. Forster. In this world we are completely depend on the machines for everything.</p><p>Another one of the Age of Em by Rob Hanson is which the primary humans who are
still economically relevant are synthetic humans who exist in digital cities or
completely virtually.</p><p>Another short story is I, Robot.
This was also made into a movie in which the machines
decided the maximally efficient solution for humans to remain unharmed was to keep
them isolated and under a panopticon. A panopticon is a prison in which everyone
is being monitored at all times and disciplined for any transgression.</p><p>The Positronic Man by Asimov is story covering which covers numerous topics most importantly
to me the chauvinism of humanity. It was later turned into the movie Bicenntial Man with Robin Williams.</p><p>As Robert Sapolsky said with extreme sarcasm &ldquo;For all creatures are unique, but humans
are the unique-est.&rdquo;
What Sapolsky is getting at is that humans have the delusion they are the most
important organism from an objective and cosmic perspective when in fact they are not.
There is no objective reason to say this is the case.
It is a case of value constellations in which we&rsquo;ve selected our own biased
value system to decided that a certain configuration of values matter most.
Why? Simply because they matter the most to us. Pure conceited arguments
for our own perspective. If bees in our position and highly intelligent
honey making would probably be high on the list. You may chuckle but
it is equally as ridiculous to select whatever constellation of values you&rsquo;ve
chosen.
All values are contextual and instrumental to the goals used.
There may be universal values but that&rsquo;s a tough one to argue for.</p><p>There are numerous other books and movies on the topic, but
many I think do not lay out plausible future possibilities.
I will name one more I liked Do Robots dream of electric Sheep?</p><h1 id=what-do-you-see-in-the-sloggoth>What do you see in the Sloggoth?

over the glistening floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter.&rdquo;</p><p>— H. P.
