“Whenever serious and competent people need to get things done in the real world, all considerations of tradition and protocol fly out the window.” ~ Neal Stephenson
The status quo is taken seriously for many reasons, because most people are conservative in a way that few ever state or articulate completely– This convention, institution, etc. is the right way because it is the way I know best.</description></item><item><title>Enterprising Investor</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/enterprising-investor/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 16:38:11 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/enterprising-investor/</guid><description>Disclaimer I am not an investment advisor.

For one, I started without taking any of my baseline assumptions for granted and applied my skepticism as best as I could to &amp;ldquo;commong knowledge&amp;rdquo; ways of looking at happiness.
Overall the course was a good start on a life long journey to find meaning and happiness. Many of the findings are common knowledge, but definitely not common practice.</description></item><item><title>Decreasing Consumption, Increasing Happiness</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/decreasing-consumption/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/decreasing-consumption/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time to stop pointing fingers, finger pointing gets us no-where, Steve!&amp;rdquo; ~ Randy Marsh, South Park
In the past year I have reduced my carbon footprint to about 10% that of an average American without much effort. How?
Before telling other people how to live, I have found it is a good idea to examine my life thoroughly first. I know, I know&amp;ndash; where is the fun in that?</description></item><item><title>Perspectives on Progress</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/perspectives-on-progress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/perspectives-on-progress/</guid><description>I have thought about progress for a long time and learned much. For one, I learned the business of forecasting is littered with fake experts and real experts that are easily separable when you put aside most authority and other logical fallacies and simply figure out who can demonstrate their abilities under measurable conditions. In fact, it turns out super forecasters are real and use many reliable techniques to get the job done.</description></item><item><title>Ultralearning</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/ultralearning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2019 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/ultralearning/</guid><description>Background We live in a time when you can go on the internet and read about most things to some level. So can you learning the equivalent to getting an undergraduate degree from a top university? Scott Young set out on a bold project of obtaining the equivalent knowledge of an undergraduate Computer Science degree from MIT in a year. He called this project the MIT Challenge. Did he succeed in this challenge?</description></item><item><title>Digital Minimalism</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/digital-minimalism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2019 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/digital-minimalism/</guid><description>Background Something is wrong with us now days. Why is it so hard to deal with a bit of boredom or lack of stimulation from our smartphones? The answer goes deeper than many thought.
After going through Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s books: Deep Work and So Good They Can&amp;rsquo;t Ignore You I had to pick up his most recent work on the subject of software technology in our lives. This book isn&amp;rsquo;t just about getting work done, it is about getting your life back from companies who want your attention.</description></item><item><title>The Intelligent Investor</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/intelligent-investor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/intelligent-investor/</guid><description>Background Around 2014, after being recommended this book by numerous sources, I picked it up and gave it a read. Great books profoundly influence the way you think for the rest of your life. The Intelligent Investor is such a book. It challenged my initial ideas on investment, how to think about assets, and how to think about wealth. Contained within it are sound principles for first preserving what one has and then increase that pile of money safely with time.</description></item><item><title>Deep Work</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/deep-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/deep-work/</guid><description>The Gist that I got:
Create a place or places for deep work free of distraction for extended periods of well defined chunked work that are part of a strong formed habit with daily rituals of getting up and winding down. Each part of your day is segmented. Do not allow distractions or boredom to get in the way. Make sure your outside activities help support deep work meaning you don't extensively used social media, lots of video games, etc--these things train you for consistent attentional switching which is not part of deep work.</description></item><item><title>So Good They Can't Ignore You</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/so-good/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Nov 2018 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/so-good/</guid><description>Why is Following the Romantic Notion of Passion Bad Advice? I have read many books on productivity but this one stood out to me since the thesis was taking on a central dogma of a large portion of the US society: that following your passion is the key to happiness and fulfillment in the modern world. I have always been skeptical of this hypothesis, but I have not seen a well stated alternative worldview that does not have tremendous downsides.</description></item><item><title>The Originals</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-originals/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-originals/</guid><description>I rarely come away from a book with some solid actionable insights but luckily for me this book had some stellar information and a solid data driven approach to viewing the power of original thinking.
A valuable cognitive strategy I learned from the book is called defensive pessimism which can be defined by wikipedia as:
&amp;quot;When implementing defensive pessimism, individuals set low expectations for their performance, regardless of how well they have done in the past.</description></item><item><title>The Willpower Instinct</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-willpower-instinct/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/the-willpower-instinct/</guid><description>Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BXuZL1HAg

The basic idea is that a metaskill is a general skill that can be applied to numerous fields and disciplines. I thought the most important was, of course, the metaskill of all metaskills, learning to learn.</description></item><item><title>Algorithms to Live By</title><link>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/algorithms-to-live-by/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://awsaavedra.com/posts/algorithms-to-live-by/</guid><description>After listening to the 80,000 hours podcast episode 48 I realized that this book was right up my alley and decided it was worth a book review awhile ago but never put it together until now.
