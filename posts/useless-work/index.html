<p>Busyness is a choice.
I choose to get things done, not be busy.
Most actions are futile or irrelevant to your goals.
Most things you care about are not being taken care of.</p>
<p>“I can’t help but wonder whether all this histrionic exhaustion isn’t a way of covering up the fact that most of what we do doesn’t matter.” –Tim Kreider</p>
<p>Do you want to get things done or be busy? Choose wisely.</p>
<p>Do less, better.</p>
<p>During College I was volunteered, to my deep dismay, to discuss how I got &ldquo;so much done&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The student I was talking to asked me all sorts of questions but he truly believed you either had to do choose of the following: sleep, good grades, or socialize.
He thought it was impossible to do all three.</p>
<p>This is both false and fundamentally wrong.</p>
<p>He was shocked I never pulled an all nighter in my life.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t believe I had an active social life as well.</p>
<p>In fact, after finishing the book How to be a Straight A Student by Cal Newport I noticed a pretty obvious pattern. People who are successful are usually good at getting the foundational things right: sleep comes first and so does health, only after these things can one be effective.</p>
<p>You must actively choose between tradeoffs and stacking activites properly to get everything that <strong>actually</strong> matters done.</p>
<p>I remember hearing a story that the space between words was invented and it was a massive achievement. You could take away many things from that, but most importantly that both the content and space between them matter.</p>
<p>In intensely innovative and creative activities the time to sit, contemplate, and meander around are as important as the time doing heads down work.</p>
<p>Why? There are many scientific reasons related to how our brains work but the important part is we know this for a fact.</p>
<p>There was a large scale study of scientific productivity and what was found is that a scientist working about 8 hours a day with 3-5 hours of &ldquo;Deep Work&rdquo; was optimal. This is about human limits but also the fact that more work isn&rsquo;t better.</p>
<p>More work isn&rsquo;t better, in fact it was detrimental.</p>
<p>This goes against a lot of grind culture and hustle culture.</p>
<p>Meandering time matters.</p>
<p>If you are accomplishing what matters most to you you&rsquo;re usually focused on a small number of important things. It is a form of minimalism.</p>
<p>It is a form of liberation.</p>
<p>Most labor is maintaining things, make sure they&rsquo;re the right things.</p>
<p>Measure things in time, your time.</p>
<p>“The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” ― Henry David Thoreau, Walden</p>
<p>Live simply and deeply.
Life is easier this way and you will not be busy.</p>
