<p>I have thought about progress for a long time and learned much. For one, I
learned the business of forecasting is littered with fake experts
and real experts that are easily separable when you put aside most authority
and other logical fallacies and simply figure out who can demonstrate
their abilities under measurable conditions.
In fact, it turns out super forecasters are real and use many reliable techniques to get
the job done. I read a book on it called <em>Superforecasting</em> and I thought it was
somewhat interesting.</p>
<p>However, what I am interested in is not short term prediction or forecasting in this case.
I have been searching for the perspectives on technological progress and how it will play out in the next 100 years. What are the majors areas of change that we
should be expecting?</p>
<h1 id=the-one-off-event-scenario>The One Off Event Scenario</h1>
<p>This one has plenty of basis in reality from climate change, nuclear war, and many
mounting threats. This camp is made up of potentially prominent figures including
people from the early retirement community. How will this likely play out?
Mounting ecological disasters and threats from the first world. Is this century
of rapid progress just a footnote in history and the actual reality is progress
will typically be slow and steady or flat?</p>
<h1 id=linear-progress-camp>Linear Progress Camp</h1>
<p>Although the exponential camp has many graphs, this group has many as well to illustrate
the simple thesis:</p>
<pre><code>Things are getting better but exponentially harder to solve as we pick all the
low hanging fruits of progress.
</code></pre>
<p>The strongest argument I have heard for this camp comes from the
Artificial General Intelligence Podcast by Lex Fridman. Additional resources link 13.</p>
<h1 id=only-the-software-is-improving-rapidly-camp>Only the Software is Improving Rapidly Camp</h1>
<p>This camp sees progress in software as the final frontier given the other areas
of scientific and technological progress has slowed down. It has many strong arguments
including but not limited to Space flight slowing down, electric cars and green
technologies not improving at the rate of technological destruction.</p>
<p>Within this camp, we can see that this technological trend has many benefits including
our progress no longer causes as much ecological damage to the environment.</p>
<p>Resource link 17.</p>
<h1 id=the-exponential-progress-folks>The Exponential Progress Folks</h1>
<p>People in this camp believe progress will be exponential in all fields, especially
once the super intelligent artificial general intelligence comes online to save us&mldr;
or destroy us. Progress appears slow until it takes off.</p>
<p>Notable figures: Ray Kurzweil and Ben Goertzel</p>
<p>Many counter arguments to the nerd rapture can be found, but the most notable
to me were from [AGI podcast], Richard Stallman [singularityNet video].
Most of the counter arguments are knee jerk so it is, frankly, hard to find
good arguments against this perspective unless it is from the above camps mentioned.</p>
<h1 id=the-questioning-progress-as-a-good-camp>The Questioning Progress as a Good Camp</h1>
<p>Other arguments exist against progress as a tautological good (true no matter what).</p>
<p>Anywhere from the Brave New World argument that simply eliminating undesirable things
does not, ultimately, make life better. Is the pursuit of happiness the goal?</p>
<p>Another perspective I truly enjoyed was Derek Sivers view, similar to the mexican
fisherman story, is more really better? Those that
constantly struggle for more often forget the one thing they will never have is
<strong>enough</strong>.</p>
