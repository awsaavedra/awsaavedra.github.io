  <p>&ldquo;To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our life is frittered away by detail.[&hellip;] Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb-nail.&rdquo;  ~ Henry David Thoreau</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are questions so important that it is, or should be, hard to think about anything else.&rdquo; ~ Enough by Jack Bogle quoting Glenn While at Princeton</p>
<p>Rabbi Heschel replied: “I would say: Let them remember that there is a meaning beyond absurdity. Let them be sure that every little deed counts, that every word has power, and that we can—every one—do our share to redeem the world in spite of all absurdities and all frustrations and all disappointments. And above all, remember that the meaning of life is to build a life as if it were a work of art. ~ Robert K. Greenleaf, Servant Leadership: A Journey into the Nature of Legitimate Power and Greatness</p>
<p>“A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play; his labor and his leisure; his mind and his body; his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing, and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always appears to be doing both.” — Lawrence Pearsall Jacks</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible; thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habits; thought is anarchic and lawless, indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. It sees man, a feeble speck, surrounded by unfathomable depths of silence; yet it bears itself proudly, as unmoved as if it were lord of the universe. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth is a shining goddess, always veiled, always distant, never wholly approachable, but worthy of all the devotion of which the human spirit is capable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should wish to preach the &ldquo;will-to-doubt.&rdquo; None of our beliefs are quite true; all at least have a penumbra of vagueness and error. What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the will to find out, which is the exact opposite.&rdquo; ~ Betrand Russell</p>
<p>“The greatest thing a man can do in this world, is to make the most possible out of the stuff that has been given him. This is success, and there is no other.”― Orison Swett Marden, Learn to Expect a Great Deal of Life</p>
<p>“Wisdom cannot be imparted. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to impart always sounds like foolishness to someone else [&hellip;] Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it.” ― Hermann Hesse, Siddhartha</p>
<p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. ~ Theodore Roosevelt</p>
<p>“Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose. I have read and heard many attempts at a systematic account of it, from materialism and theosophy to the Christian system or that of Kant, and I have always felt that they were much too simple. I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth that are dreamed of, or can be dreamed of, in any philosophy. That is the reason why I have no philosophy myself, and must be my excuse for dreaming.” ― J. B. S. Haldane, Possible Worlds</p>
<p>&ldquo;Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.&rdquo; ~ Donald Knuth</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never lose the child-like wonder. It&rsquo;s just too important. It&rsquo;s what drives us.&rdquo; ~ Randy Pausch</p>
<p>“Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.” ~ Richard Feynman</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the important things right.&rdquo; ~ N. P. Calderwood</p>
